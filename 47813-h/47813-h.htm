<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Pen and brush are both necessary in the attempt
to give an impression of a country; word-painting
for the brain, colour for the eye. Yet even then there
must be gaps and a sad lack of completeness, which
is felt by no one more than by the coadjutors who
have produced this book. There are so many aspects
under which a country may be seen. In the case
of Normandy, for instance, one man looks for
magnificent architecture alone, another for country
scenes, another for peasant life, and each and all
will cavil at a book which does not cater for their
particular taste. Cavil they must; the artist and
author here have tried&mdash;knowing well how far short
of the ideal they have fallen&mdash;to show Normandy
as it appeared to them, and the matter must be
coloured by their personalities. Thus they plead
for leniency, on the ground that no one person’s view
can ever exactly be that which satisfies another.</p>

<span class="subhead">IN GENERAL</span></h2>

<p>It is a task of extreme difficulty to set down
on paper what may be called the character of a
country; it includes so much&mdash;the historical past,
the solemn and magnificent buildings, the antiquity
of the towns, the nature of the landscape, the
individuality of the people; and besides all these
large and important facts, there must be more
than a reference to distinctive customs, quaint
street scenes, peculiarities in costume, manners,
and style of living. Only when all these topics
have been mingled and interwoven to form a comprehensive
whole, can we feel that justice is done
to a country. Yet when the scope of the book
has been thus outlined, the manner of it remains
to be considered, and on the manner depends
all or nearly all the charm. It will not answer the
purpose we have in view to follow the methods of
guide-book writing; that careful pencil-drawing, where
each small object receives the same detailed recognition
in accordance with its size as does each large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
fact, is not for us; for it is essential that the whole
must consist of wide areas of light and shade, to
make definite impressions. Many people have passed
through the country, guide-book in hand, have
studied the style of every cathedral, have seen the
spot where Joan of Arc was murdered, and where
William the Conqueror was born, but have come
back again without having once felt that shadowy
and intangible thing, the character of Normandy,
wherein lies its fascination.</p>

<p>It seems, then, that the only possible way to aim at
this high ideal will be to exercise the principle of
selection; to choose those things which are typical and
representative, whether of a particular town or the
whole country, to describe in detail some points which
may be found in many places, and to leave the rest.
A town-to-town tour, with everything minute,
accurate, at the same level, would be wearisome and
unimpressive, however useful as a guide-book. Here
we shall wander and ramble, selecting one or two
objects for special attention, perhaps by reason of
their singularity, perhaps for the opposite reason,
because they are typical of many of their kind, and
by this method we shall gain some general idea of the
country, without becoming tedious by reason of too
much detail, or vague for lack of it.</p>

<p>It has often been said that Normandy is a
beautiful country, or as it is less happily expressed,
“So pretty,” and this is not altogether true; no
doubt there are parts of Normandy which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
beautiful, such as the banks of the Seine, and the
country about Mortain and Domfront, but there are
also parts as dully monotonous as the worst of
Holland or Picardy. To know the country, one must
see all kinds, and perhaps with knowledge we shall
get to feel even for the plainer parts that affection
which comes with knowledge of a dear but plain
face.</p>

<p>The present chapter, however, is merely preliminary
and discursive, with the object of giving some general
idea of the country as a background before filling in
the groups destined for the foreground. The place
where the majority of English people first strike
Normandy is Dieppe. The coast-line running north
and south of Dieppe is famous for its bathing-places
and pleasure resorts, and it will be dealt with later on.</p>

<p>The district lying between Dieppe and the Seine
is known as Caux. The route from Dieppe to
Paris is well known to many a traveller, and the
feeling of anyone who sees it for the first time will
probably be surprise at its likeness to England. If
the journey be in the spring-time, he will see cowslips
and cuckoo flowers in the lush green grass, amid
which stand cows of English breed. The woods will
be spangled with starry-eyed primrose and anemones,
while long bramble creepers trail over the sprouting
hedges. Even the cottages, red-tiled or thatched,
are quite familiar specimens; and it is only when some
rigid chateau, in the hideous style most affected by
modern France, built of glaring brick, and with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
utter absence of all attempt at architectural grace, is
seen up a vista of formal trees, that he will realise he is
not in the Midlands.</p>

<p>Then we come to the banks of the Seine. Perhaps
if one had to choose out of all Normandy, one would
select the country lying within and around those
great horseshoe loops of the river as admittedly the
most beautiful part. So full of interest and variety is
the course of the Seine, that we have reserved a
special chapter for an account of it between Havre
and Vernon. However, beautiful as it is, this part is
not quite so characteristically Norman as some other
districts. The Seine itself, though it flows for so
long through Normandy, does not belong to it, but to
France; the people who live on its banks are more
French than Norman, and we have to go farther
westward to find more typical scenery. The country
lying about Gisors, and between that town and the
Seine, was called the Vexin, and formed a debatable
ground on which many a contest was fought, and
which was held by France and Normandy in turn.</p>

<p>To the west of the Seine the country varies.
Some towns, like Lisieux, lie surrounded by broken
ground well clothed by trees, while much of the
district, notably that south of Evreux, is monotonous
and almost devoid of hills at all.</p>

<p>We find here some instances of those long,
straight roads which it seems to be the highest
ideal of the Vicinal Committee to make. We shall
meet them again in plenty elsewhere, but may as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
well describe them here. Take for instance that
road running between Evreux and Lisieux; it undulates
slightly, and at each little crest the white
ribbon can be seen rising and falling, and growing
at last so small in the endless perspective, that it
almost vanishes from sight. Six miles from any
town a man is found carefully brushing the dust
from this road, though what good he can possibly
do by the clouds he raises with his long, pliant sweep
is a mystery. On each side of the road there is
a broad ribbon of green, and in this case it is
overhung by a double row of trees that really do
give some shade. The peasants walk in this green
aisle, but even with the grass underfoot the patience
needed to traverse perpetually such monotonous
roads must be great; it is the quality often found
in those whose lives know little variety. Sometimes
these high roads are planted with poplars, which
mock the wayfarer, for like so many other trees in
France, these poplars are stripped of all their boughs
almost to the top, and the little tuft of light leaves
remaining gives no relief to sight or sense on a
glaring road under a summer sun; oaks, horse-chestnuts,
beeches&mdash;almost any other tree, and all
seem to grow well&mdash;would have been far better for
shade and comfort; yet for one road planted with
these umbrageous trees a dozen are lined by
the scanty and disappointing poplar. Along them
pass the market carts with hoods like those of a
victoria; and even the drivers of slow travelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
carts supply themselves with miniature hoods, exactly
like those of perambulators, to cover their seats,
for no one could endure the hours passed in the sun
without some protection.</p>

<p>A great deal of Normandy is flat and bare; the
flint and trefoil style is common. Wide fields of
mustard of a crude raw yellow, not golden like the
Pomeranian lupin fields, are often to be seen. The
flat landscapes are broken by a few stiff or
scraggy trees, tethered cows, or cottages of lathe
and clay; yet, we hear the song of the lark and
scent the breath of roses, and in the spring and
early summer orchards of cherry blossom make
gleaming sheets of white on many a roadside.</p>

<p>The valley of the River Rille, up which Pont
Audemer lies, is of a different style altogether,
still it has characteristics in common with other
districts. The valley is flat, and from it on each
side so steeply rise the fir-crowned hills that in
describing them one could almost use the word
rectangular. Though the trees are fairly thick there
is a ragged, unfinished, rather scrubby look, very
often seen in Normandy.</p>

<div id="ip_6" class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"><img src="images/i_022.jpg" width="700" height="453" alt="" /><div class="caption">CHERRY BLOSSOM</div></div>

<p>If we spring westward now to Caen, we find the
flat and bald landscape everywhere. The country
is almost incredibly dull, and this is the reason why
Caen, such an interesting town in itself, makes
so small an appeal as headquarters. The long,
straight roads radiate from it in all directions.
Here and there there is a lining of trees, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
generally only a green ditch, waterless, and a line
of cornfield, blue-green or yellow as the season
may be, with perhaps a ragged fringe of gnarled
apple-trees standing ankle-deep in the corn, and
the wide sky, like a great inverted bowl of clear blue,
fitting every way to the horizon. There may be
fields of deep crimson trefoil to vary the colouring,
or there may be fields yet unplanted in which the
bare brown earth seems to stretch to eternity, and
far away in the midst are the stooping figures of
two or three men and women busily working with
bent backs on a shadeless plain. Yet in this wide
flat country there is a freshness and an openness
that one might imagine could permeate the blood,
so that the peasants who were born and reared here
might suffocate and die in a mountainous country, as
the mountaineers are said to pine and die in a plain.
This flat plain to the westward of Caen, and surrounding
Bayeux in the district of the Bessin, has
been, so long as history has any record, a prime
agricultural country with magnificent pasturage.
The most notable points in the little villages which
stud it are the wonderful churches, out of all proportion
to the size of the hamlets they represent.
Of course this feature is found all over the country,
and in almost every small town there is a cathedral,
so that one cannot but wonder where the money
came from which built such glorious monuments to
piety. The line going to Bayeux runs at about
seven or eight miles from Caen, between two little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
villages, Bretteville and Norrey, which share a station
between them. The church at Norrey, built in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, is a very model
of architectural perfection and simplicity, the tall
spire is something in the style of the marvellous
St Pierre in Caen itself. Bretteville falls not far
short of it, though the tower is after a different
pattern. A very few miles on, at Andrieu, is a church
with a splendid tower of the same date as Norrey,
and about two miles south, at Tilly aux Seulles, a
church of which the nave is eleventh century, the
choir twelfth, the tower fourteenth, and the portal
fifteenth, all in the artistic and finished style we
associate with that period when there seems to have
been nothing but good work. This group of churches
is worth mentioning as striking, even in the profusion
to be found in Normandy. Leaving Caen and going
southward, we plunge before very long into the
hilly country from which the Orne rises. This is
known as the Bocage, a name which suggests rich
foliage. The part of the country in which Mortain
and Domfront lie has been called the Alps of
Normandy, and certainly it can hold its own for
picturesqueness. It is, however, comparatively little
known; the line of the quick-trip-man may touch
Falaise, but it goes no further south. Yet even at
Falaise one can see part of a ridge extending for
many kilometres, a ridge which has been so magnificently
utilised as the site of the castle where William
was born. The hills through Mortain and Domfront<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
run parallel with this ridge, and are of the same
description. Indeed the positions of the castles at
Domfront and Falaise are very similar.</p>

<div id="ip_9" class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"><img src="images/i_028.jpg" width="700" height="512" alt="" /><div class="caption">THE HARBOUR AT LOW TIDE, GRANVILLE</div></div>

<p>Turning now to a new district westward, we
find a rugged granite coast, chiefly notable for the
splendid views it affords of the bay of Mont St Michel
and its famous rock, and on a wider scale of the
Channel, where lie the Iles Causey and Iles
Normandes (Channel Isles). There are here a
group of fine towns, Avranches, Granville, Coutances,
and St Lo. The first named is the capital of
the Avranchin district, which stretches up to the
little stream Couesnon, separating Normandy and
Brittany. Thus we are almost at the end of a
general topographical survey; there remains only
that peninsula of the Côtentin, very little visited, and
entirely off the tourist track, yet in itself delightful.
The hills rise and fall, and are well covered with trees,
which, though not of a great height, grow warmly
and bushily. The roads are good, and the country
is studded with ancient chateaux, now for the most
part farmhouses, which shall have, as they deserve,
a chapter to themselves. We have thus run very
quickly over Normandy in a general survey, gaining
some idea of the characteristics of the districts, and
calling them by the ancient names they bore in the
days of the Norman dukes.</p>

<p>In regard to the people, what there is to say has
been said in the various local chapters. The quaint
costumes, which are familiar to us from many a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
picture, are fast dying out; in Normandy one sees
less of them than in Brittany; here and there, it is
true, we find a local fashion in caps, as at Valognes;
and still on feast-days and fair-days some damsel
appears in the wonderful erection of stiffening and
beautiful hand-made lace which her grandmother
wore, to be the envy of her neighbours; but in an
ordinary way these things are not seen. “On y
cherchent vainement ces riches fermiéres de la plaine
et du Bessin, dont les hautes coiffes garnies de
dentelles et les bijoux Normandes attiraient tous
les regards.”</p>

<div id="ip_10" class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;"><img src="images/i_034.jpg" width="454" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">A FESTIVAL CAP</div></div>

<p>And what is said of costumes may be said also
of customs. Le Hericher, who has made a study
of racial characteristics, says that the Normans are
not a people of imagination and idealism like the
Celtic races. “Il y a en Normandie deux localités
où on remarque une population exotique, exotique
de costume, exotique de langue; c’est Granville à
quatre lieues de Cancale, son berceau, son point de
départ; Cancalaises et Granvillaises sont des sœurs
séparées par un bras de mer. L’autre c’est le
faubourg de Dieppe, celui des pêcheuses, le Pollet.
Ces deux localités où la race est Celtique, se
distinguent par un esprit pieux qui, comme cela se
fait chez les Bretons, mêle la religion aux actes de
la vie civile et de l’existence maritime.” He adds,
“Le Normand chante peu et ne danse pas du tout.
Son voisin le Breton chante beaucoup, danse un
peu.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Nevertheless a dancing-match may still be found
in some obscure corners of Normandy.</p>

<p>The Norman has the love of country strongly
developed and though settlers have gone forth to
other lands, especially to Canada, the mother-country
retains their hearts in a peculiar way. One of the
most popular of the national songs carried overseas
<span class="locked">runs:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>A great many people who could visit Normandy
as easily as one of our own coast towns are deterred
by the difficulty of knowing where to begin, and what
route to take. Normandy is the easiest of all
countries to visit. One may begin anywhere with
the certainty of finding interest and enjoyment,
especially those who are cyclists, for the roads are as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
a rule excellent, much better than those in Brittany,
and one may stay for a longer or shorter time with
equal pleasure, for the country furnishes material for
many a month, and yet much can be seen in ten days
or a fortnight.</p>

<p>The best known starting-place, as we have said,
is Dieppe, and of the hundreds who enter Normandy
yearly, at least eighty per cent. come in by this gate.
A very usual route for a first trip is by Rouen,
Evreux, Lisieux, Caen, Bayeux, St Lo, Coutances,
Avranches, and St Mont Michel, returning from St
Malo. This for a preliminary survey is good, and
having once been in the country it is almost certain
that the traveller will go again, given the opportunity.</p>

<div id="ip_12" class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"><img src="images/i_040.jpg" width="700" height="505" alt="" /><div class="caption">A SEASIDE RESORT</div></div>

<p>There are of course many people who are content
with the sea-coast, and wish to penetrate no further
than Dieppe or Trouville, to mention the two largest
of the coast resorts. There is much to be said for
these places. There is a brilliance in the sunny air,
a gaiety in the mingling crowds, a completeness in the
round of amusements, and the opportunities for
observing one’s fellow-creatures, that are grand
elements in the tonic of change. The bathing, the
bands, the casinos, the toilets, are all excellent of
their kind, and many a tired worker goes back to that
office in the city, where his view is limited by his
neighbour’s window-reflectors, a new man for the
busy idleness of a fortnight at one of these holiday
resorts. Unfortunately for those who have not much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
to spend, the prices at the best hotels at these places
in the season are almost prohibitive. However, the
season is late, not beginning until July, and there are
sunny months before that. There are also countless
places along the coast less known, and having the
primary advantages of the others; where the sands
are just as stoneless and shadeless, and where the
sea-air is as fresh and the sky as blue, but where the
hotels are not so exorbitant, and the villas and pensions
are innumerable also. Such, to take only one example,
are the places that line the coast near Caen.</p>

<p>But this is the merest fringe of the subject. One
who has sampled the coast towns, and rushed over
the main route above described, has hardly begun
to know Normandy. He has endless choice left
for future holidays. He may make his headquarters
at Valognes to explore the Côtentin; he may settle
down at Domfront, and wander throughout that
lovely district; or he may devote himself to the
country around Les Andelys and Gisors; and everywhere
he will find opportunity for enjoyment.</p>

<p>The difficulty in passing quickly through Normandy
on a cycling or pedestrian tour is to get food when
and where you want it. To make any progress at
all in summer, it is necessary to start in good time
after a substantial meal, then to take a very light
luncheon, perhaps carried with one, and to arrive
in time for a good dinner at the day’s end. This is
very difficult of accomplishment. Such a thing as
that which an Englishman calls a good breakfast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
is almost out of the question, and the probability is
that the cyclist riding off the beaten tracks cannot
get anything at all for the rest of the day; for of all
hopeless places for eatable food, the small villages in
Normandy are the worst. Drink of some kind,
vermouth, and the sweet syrupy grenadine, can be
had at every little shanty, marked “Debit du Boisson,”
but there is nothing to eat.</p>

<div id="ip_14" class="figcenter" style="width: 455px;"><img src="images/i_046.jpg" width="455" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">GRANDMOTHER</div></div>

<p>I can recall one scene which could never have
taken place anywhere save in Normandy. An old
farmhouse with half-door, which, being opened,
admitted one to an old room toned in browns of
all shades, heavy beams, walls, and floor alike. A
few boughs, green-encrusted, and sending up a thick
smoke, lie on the open hearth. A little old dame,
of any age one likes to guess, with wizened nut-brown
face encircled by a spotless close-fitting coif,
is the lady of the house. Her face is one to which
Rembrandt alone could have done justice, with an
expression at once kindly, dignified, and shrewd. On
the rough table, hacked and hewed by many a
knife, are set bowls of milk strongly tasting of wood
smoke. Sour cream is spread like jam on slices
roughly carved from a loaf the size of a bicycle
wheel, and about as hard as deal wood. The cream
is very sour, and a few lumps of sugar are served
out with it to be grated over it. The old dame
sits by with folded hands while the party laugh
over their strange meal, but as the laughter continues
she grows slightly anxious, and asks to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
assured that she is not the object of it; a royal
compliment in the best French at the command of
the best linguist of the party chases away anxiety,
and also for the moment dignity and shrewdness,
leaving nothing but delight pure and simple on that
dear old work-worn face.</p>

<p>It is the fashion to praise French cooking, but
to an Englishman who has passed the day bicycling
with nothing but a couple of soft-boiled eggs and
some sour cream, there is something unsatisfying
about the ordinary dinner menu at a French hotel.
The monotonous soup, always <i>maigre</i>; the dull
variety of nameless white fish, which seems to be
kept in stock as a staple; the little tasteless pieces
of veal, all the same size and shape cut on a dish;
the leathery and half-raw mutton, also cut in the
same way; the very small variety of vegetables,
and utter absence of attempt at sweets&mdash;is not an
appetising menu. The French are apparently very
conservative in their food. A traveller of eighty years
ago tells us: “The breakfast at the table d’hôte at
Argentan, as at every other place where I stopped,
was of exactly the same nature as their dinners.
That is, soup, fish, meat of different kinds, eggs,
salad, and a dessert with cider; no potatoes or any
other vegetable but asparagus at any meal,” and
this would be a very fair account of an hotel menu
nowadays. The worst fault seems to be monotony,
always chicken, gigot, or veal. Of course, at the
very first-class hotels, at places such as Dieppe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
where English influence has penetrated, things are
certainly better, but in the ordinary best hotel in
a second-class town, the food is very unsatisfactory,
and the meat always tough and bad, in spite of the
splendid pasture lands and the fine fat beasts one
sees grazing; good beef is very rare, and good
mutton unknown. In this respect Normandy
seems to have been unvaryingly the same, for the
traveller above quoted writes also: “With occasional
exceptions, the meat in this part of Normandy
(Caen) is of inferior quality, more particularly the
mutton, which is generally as lean and tough as an
old shoe.” So often has the praise of French
vegetables been repeated, that one has learned to
take it as an axiom, until one goes and finds out
for oneself. The truth is there is less, not more
variety, than with us; such a thing as a good spring
cabbage is unknown, and cauliflower is served only
<i>au gratin</i>. Yet the hotels have improved enormously
in many points in the last seven or eight years.
They have their advantages, and in some ways
every French hotel, even the poorest, can beat its
English compeers. The great advantage of cheap
wine is felt at every hotel in Normandy; the question
of what to drink at dinner, usually such a difficult
one, is solved for you. On the table, almost everywhere,
are red and white wine and seltzer water
“compris”; and at every hotel, without exception,
cider, varying it is true greatly as to quality, can
be had for the asking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
The hotels are also cheap. At those of the first
class, 1 franc is the average charge for the petit
déjeuner meal; the déjeuner is generally 3; and
the dinner 3.50; while the room may be taken
at an average price of 3 francs. Therefore a full
day at an hotel usually costs 10.50 francs, or
<i>en pension</i> 10 francs, equalling between 8 and 9
shillings; but at fashionable coast resorts in the
season 15 francs per day is the lowest rate, and
in the out-of-the-way districts, and off the beaten
tracks, 7 and 8 francs a day are the usual charges.
At any rate, in Normandy one is free from the
ridiculous impost called “attendance,” which entails
an additional 1s. 6d. a day in many English and
Scotch hotels, while tipping is expected just the
same.</p>

<p>Many of the hotels have a forbidding aspect
outside; until one is used to it, it is a little damping
to enter under a low archway leading to a
stableyard, but the entry is often the worst part
of it. An Englishman touring through the country
will find as a rule he is able to find without difficulty
quarters which possess all requisites though not
luxuries.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE NORMAN DUKES</span></h2>

<p>Normandy is probably at the same time the best
and the least known place on the Continent to
Englishmen: the best known, because the most
accessible; the least known, because, beyond the
fact that the Duke of Normandy conquered England
in the year 1066, and that it is in consequence
from Normandy that our line of kings is derived,
the average Englishman knows little or nothing of
its history or associations. Ask him plainly: What is
the extent of Normandy? and he will answer vaguely,
“It is the north of France.” So it is, a part of the
north of France, but not the whole. As a matter of
fact, the term Normandy has now little geographical
meaning. Normandy is not a province for practical
purposes, nor does it carry any civil boundaries
marking customs, or law, or government. Normandy
embraces the departments of Manche, Orne, Eure,
Calvados, and Seine Inférieure; that is to say, it
reaches from Eu and its port Le Tréport on the
east; to the stream Couesnon, which flows into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
English Channel a little beyond Mont St Michel on
the west; and southward it just takes in Alençon, dips
down to a point near La Ferté Bernard, returning
with a wavering north-eastward line across the Seine
at Vernon, and by Gisors to Eu aforesaid. It
answers also to the modern dioceses of Rouen,
Evreux, Séez, Bayeux, and Coutances. The
Archbishop of Rouen still keeps the title of
Primate of Normandy, otherwise the name has
gone out of formal use, and Normandy is merged
in France.</p>

<p>Yet it is extraordinary with what tenacity and
affection Englishmen regard a name which links the
dwellers in the land to them as kin, and it is still
more extraordinary how, after centuries of submersion,
beneath a rule entirely French, the kinship
makes itself felt in manner and character as well as
in memory. The qualities of the sturdy northmen
whose bravery and roving dispositions led them to
lands far from their own, and made them at home
everywhere, still exist in their descendants, as the
colonies of England testify. When the Danes had
settled down upon the north of France “they were,”
says Freeman, “no longer Northmen but Normans;
the change in the form of the name aptly expresses
the change in those who bore it.” Yet many and
many a vessel full of vikings discharged itself on that
land without making any impression, until one came
bearing the mighty Rollo, who was destined to stay
and make a permanent mark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
The France of those days, torn by dissensions,
was not the homogeneous country we now know.
Long before Cæsar first conquered Gaul, and in the
time of his successor Augustus, Lyons was the capital;
then came the Germans and Goths, who began to overrun
the land, and a little later the low German tribe of
the Franks came also; they were destined to give
their name to a land alien from their own, just as
the modern name of Scotland was brought over the
sea originally by the men of Ireland. It was in the
beginning of the sixth century that the greater part
of Gaul lay under the dominion of Clovis, King of the
Franks. Yet after his death, in accordance with the
German custom, the kingdom was divided among
his sons, one province being Neustria, which included
what we know as Normandy, and endless struggles
ensued, until in the middle of the seventh century
arose the great Charlemagne, who ruled by his might
over all central Europe, now divided into many
nations. But in the struggle between his grandsons,
his great dominion was split up, one grandson
taking what is now Germany, another Italy, and the
third, and most powerful, Charles the Bald, holding
France. He had for his kingdom “all Gaul west of
the Scheldt, the Meuse, the Saône, and the Rhone;
it ran down to the Mediterranean, and was thence
bounded by the Pyrenees and the Atlantic.”
Brittany was still savagely independent, however, and
the northern coasts of Neustria were ravaged by the
Northmen. The county of Paris became part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
possessions of the duchy of France, and Robert the
Strong, made duke by Charles the Bald, was set
to fight against the northern marauders, who had
penetrated even to Paris. But the descendants of
the great Charles were weak and feeble, and as
his house declined that of Robert the Strong grew,
culminating in his great-grandson, Hugh Capet,
who, on the death of the last of the direct line of
degenerate Carlovingians, became king of the France
that we know.</p>

<p>But before Capet had succeeded in seating himself
on the throne, the Northmen had settled permanently
in France. In the reign of Charles the Bald’s grandson,
Charles the Simple, Rollo or Rolf, the Northman,
had established himself at Rouen, and the king
had made terms with him, giving him his daughter
to wife, and granting him a tract of land from the
Epte to the sea, with Rouen as its heart. This was
in 912, and is the first recognised settlement of the
Northmen. Rollo himself is a fine bold figure, only
surpassed by one other among his descendants. His
frame was gigantic, and when in full armour no horse
could carry him. He seems to have combined, with
the strenuous virile qualities of the northerners, the
capacity for organisation and settled government
belonging to a later period, and a more civilised
people. He embraced the faith of his wife Gisella,
and was baptized under the name of Robert, though
it is as Rollo he will be known and remembered. He
was the founder of Normandy, and under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
government, learning and industry sprang up and
flourished. His followers received the softening
influences of the French, and the French language
began to be spoken in Normandy.</p>

<p>The first Normandy was, as has been said, the
district lying around Rouen, but in 924 the district
of Bayeux was added to it, hereafter to become a
stronghold of the older language and customs against
the Frenchified influences of Rouen. Freeman says:
“Nowhere out of old Saxon or Frisian lands can
we find another portion of continental Europe
which is so truly a brother land of our own. The
district of Bayeux, occupied by a Saxon colony in
the latest days of the old Roman empire, occupied
again by a Scandinavian colony as the result of
its conquest by Rolf, has retained to this day a
character which distinguishes it from any other
Romance-speaking portion of the Continent.”</p>

<p>As we have seen, at the time of Rolf’s settlement
in Neustria there were two powers in France,
the King of France, Charles the Simple, and the
powerful Duke of the French, who included in his
dominions the future capital, Paris. It was to the
King of France that Rolf did homage as overlord;
and the story goes that the proud Northman, on
being told to kiss the monarch’s foot by way of
homage, deputed one of his men to act as his proxy,
and that this man, no humbler than his master,
contemptuously raised the king’s foot to his own
mouth, thereby oversetting the monarch. The story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
is probably apocryphal, but it has lived with odd
persistence.</p>

<p>Rollo died in 931, and a few years after his death
his son William Longsword had the satisfaction of
adding to his lands the district of Côntentin, including
the peninsula and the land as far south as
Granville. He obtained this additional land when
he was suppressing what was called a revolt of the
Bretons&mdash;for the Dukes of Normandy held shadowy
rights over Brittany, rights which they were never
able to enforce. By his new conquest the Channel
Isles were included in Normandy, and oddly enough
it was thus they became attached to the English
crown, for when the Norman dukes, as kings of
England, lost all their other French possessions,
they retained the islands. William Longsword was
of a softer mould than his father, and from what
can be gathered from the chronicles of the time he
was a man of a thoughtful cast of mind, serious
and gentle, a character rare enough in his age. He
was succeeded by his son Richard, who, of all the
Norman dukes except the Conqueror himself, is the
best known to English people from Miss Yonge’s
charming story, <i>The Little Duke</i>, in which it is to
be feared she regards both father and son through a
haze of idealisation; but it is indeed difficult if not
impossible to make sufficient allowances for the
radically different cast of thought in a bygone age,
and to draw men as they really were. Richard the
Fearless reigned for more than fifty years, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
was ten years before his death that Hugh Capet
combined in himself the power of the kings and
dukes of France, and became the first king of consolidated
France. Richard had been sent as a lad
to Bayeux, in order that he might be brought up
under the influences of the country of his ancestors
instead of becoming too much Frenchified; but he
was of a vigorous disposition, and there seems to
have been no reason to believe that he would have
suffered unduly from any softening influence.</p>

<p>Nothing is more striking in the early annals of
France than the succession of weak rulers she
produced; occasionally there arose a man of capacity
and power, but his sons were invariably weaklings.
France does not seem to have been able to carry
on a strong ruling race. In contrast to this, note
the towering figures of the Norman dukes&mdash;the
gigantic Rolf, the wise William Longsword, Richard
the Fearless, Robert the Devil, William the
Conqueror&mdash;all men of exceptional power and
capacity. The infusion of Norman blood seems to
have given just that basic power of endurance
needed in the Teutonic nation. Richard the Fearless
was succeeded by his son Richard the Good,
and he by two of his sons successively, another
Richard, and Robert the Devil or the Magnificent
(see p. <a href="#Page_34">34</a>). It was Roberts son William, who, left
as a child to his inheritance, became the most
famous of his race. No story of romance or legend
is more wonderful than that of the Conqueror. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
present we leave it aside to form the theme of a
separate chapter, so as not to prolong too far this
sketch of Norman history, which is necessary for
any understanding of the topographical allusions.</p>

<p>With the Conquest, Normandy began to sink in
importance; as in the case of a mother who has
brought forth a son, destined to wield power and
occupy positions far beyond her capacity, she herself
took a secondary place. To be the independent
King of England was grander than to be Duke of
Normandy subject to the kings of France, and it
needed but a generation or two to make the English
forget the fact of their being conquered, and to
look upon Normandy as a appanage of the English
crown. It was a strange position altogether; the
best blood of Normandy was emptied into England
at the Conquest; abbots, warriors, nobles, men of
learning and men of birth settled in the new country
and became the English, and England found herself
so much Normanised as to be transformed.</p>

<p>It is customary to consider that the history of
Normandy ends with the conquest of England,
being thenceforth merged in that of the greater
country; but though the importance of Normandy
as a country was lessened by the union, her history
is by no means identical with that of England.
Normandy several times enjoyed a sovereign prince
altogether distinct from him who wore the crown of
England, and this state of affairs began immediately
after the death of William the Conqueror, who left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
the duchy to his eldest son Robert, while the second
son William became King of England. Of Robert
we know chiefly that he suffered from an incurable
“mollesse,” and further, as regards personal details,
that as “Jambes eût cortes, gros les os,” he earned
the nickname of Court-hose. This son of a famous
father and admirable mother, was a libertine, given
over to pleasure, incapable of taking decisive action,
one of those weak characters on which experience
cannot engrave permanent lines, but withal full of
the courage of his race. He was, however, unable
to hold what had been left him. William had
prophesied that his youngest son Henry should be
greater than both his brothers, and Henry soon
began to fulfil the parental prophecy by seizing and
holding for himself the Côtentin peninsula, and with
it the lordship of Mortain. Nothing is more significant
of the grasping natures of the trio of brothers
than the way in which they changed over, first one
couple joining against the remaining one, and then
almost immediately breaking up for a fresh combination.
William and Henry warred against
Robert; Henry and Robert combined to thwart
William; William and Robert mutually agreed to
keep Henry out of the succession, and so on;
exactly as self-interest dictated for the moment.
Finally William came uppermost, and Robert
submitted, and henceforth practically held his duchy
at the pleasure of his brother. It was Henry’s turn
to be the “odd man out,” and he fled before his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
elder brothers, taking refuge in Mont St Michel,
where they both besieged him. He had to submit,
and, yielding up the fortress, retired a penniless
adventurer. But in some way he afterwards
regained the whole of the Côtentin. When the
crusading mania began, Robert was seized with it;
under his rule Normandy had been wretchedly
governed, and little he cared. For a comparatively
small sum he mortgaged his duchy to his brother
William the Red, for six years, and went off to
the Holy Land. Normandy was probably the
better for his action. In returning from the Holy
Land, he managed to occupy a year in the journey,
and on the way he married Sybilla, daughter of Count
Geoffrey of Flanders. He had already, it may be
stated, two sons and a daughter, who seem to have
inherited the best of the traits of his house. One
of the sons, Richard, while on a visit to his uncle
William in England, was accidentally killed in the
New Forest.</p>

<div id="ip_27" class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;"><img src="images/i_068.jpg" width="452" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">ENTRANCE TO MONT ST MICHEL</div></div>

<p>Sybilla attempted to reclaim her husband from the
crowd of bad companions who gathered round him
on his re-entry into Normandy, and when Robert
was tired of her, as he soon became of everything,
he found this inconvenient, so in less than two years
she died suddenly of poison. Robert had returned
too late to put in a bid for the throne of England!
which was already occupied by Henry; but the
death of William freed him from any obligation to
pay back the debt on his duchy, and Sybilla’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
dowry went in other directions. Henry now made a
treaty with his brother, by which he delivered up the
Côtentin, but kept Domfront and Mortain. However,
becoming once more embroiled with Robert,
he quickly won for himself the whole duchy, clinching
the matter at the famous battle of Tinchebray,
whereby the process of his father was reversed,
and the King of England now conquered Normandy
as the Duke of Normandy had then conquered
England. After the terrible death of his son near
Barfleur, Henry set his heart on the succession of
his daughter Maude, who had been married first to
the Emperor of Germany, and afterwards on his
death, evidently by her father’s choice, to Geoffrey
Plantagenet, Count of Anjou and Maine, one of the
most powerful of the rulers who might have opposed
her succession in Normandy. Yet Maude never
ascended the throne that her father had so carefully
guarded for her. It is true that a claimant who
might have proved very formidable, William, the
remaining son of Robert, had died seven years before
his uncle Henry, but there remained the two sons of
Adela, daughter of the Conqueror; of these the
younger, Stephen, was determined to oust his cousin.
During the weary civil war that followed, Normandy
was many times traversed by one party or the other,
but on the whole the country declared for Stephen.
The Count of Anjou was an hereditary enemy, and
the Normans did not relish the idea of being governed
by him in his wife’s name. When at last, after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
death of Stephen’s son Eustace, it was settled that
Henry should be recognised as next heir to his
cousin, the land enjoyed peace. With the accession
of Henry a fresh era began, for the new king held
in France not only Normandy, but in right of his
mother and his wife, Touraine, Anjou, Maine, and
Acquitaine&mdash;together more than half the country&mdash;a
formidable vassal for the French king! Henry was
tenacious of his rights, and it was only as his turbulent
sons grew older, and displayed to the full those
unfilial dispositions so common in their race, that
he consented to divide some of his possessions
among them, to be held from him as lord. His gifts
were many times changed, but it seems certain that
Richard had ruled in Acquitaine as an independent
sovereign before his father’s death, while Geoffrey,
by his marriage with Constance, heiress of Brittany,
became Duke of Brittany. Henry gave to his
youngest and best loved John the title of Count of
Mortain, and with it the vicounty of the Côtentin;
and in 1181 he made his eldest son, Henry, Duke
of Normandy. But Henry the younger did not
long survive, dying at the early age of twenty-eight,
after rebelling against his father almost continuously
since his attainment of manhood. Therefore,
at the death of the king, Richard came to the
throne. John still continued ruler of Mortain and
the Côtentin under his brother, and these dominions
gave him an opportunity for putting in practice those
treasonable conspiracies by which he hoped to throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
off Richard’s yoke, and become an independent
sovereign. Richard, however, was too strong for
him; he marched into Normandy, and speedily
showed himself master. Thereupon John came
humbly to ask forgiveness at Lisieux. The story
goes that Richard, with the open-minded heartiness
which won him so much more love than his worse
qualities merited, exclaimed that he forgave him
freely, and set his behaviour down to bad influence,
as he was only a child. As John was then six-and-twenty,
this reason must have galled him had he
possessed an atom of pride, but we have reason to
think he did not. While Richard was otherwise
engaged in the Holy Land and on the Continent,
John made a second attempt to win his realms,
which was brought to an end by a knowledge of
his brother’s death. He heard this while at
Carentan, and gleefully hastened to take advantage
of it. True, there was still a boy to be reckoned
with, young Arthur, son of his dead brother
Geoffrey&mdash;a boy who was already Duke of
Brittany, and who inherited to the full the proud
fierce temper of his mother Constance. But John
had two points in his favour: first, that in the old
days a brother was often considered to have a better
right to a throne, especially if he were a man, than
a nephew who was still a child, and this idea had
not altogether died out; secondly, the Normans of
all people would have been the last to yield homage
to the duke of the hated Bretons, their nearest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
neighbours, with whom they had been perpetually at
war, and for whom they felt a fierce jealousy. On
the other hand, Arthur had a powerful ally in Philip,
King of France, who saw that it would be much more
to his own advantage to have a weak boy as ruler
of Normandy than a man equal to himself in cunning
and craftiness. Therefore Philip helped Arthur, and
even promised him his little daughter in marriage.
But unluckily for the boy who was the principal actor
in the drama, he fell into the hands of his uncle,&mdash;some
say he was captured by treachery while asleep,&mdash;however
that may be, he was in John’s clutches, and
little chance was there for him to get out again.
This was in August 1202. John carried his prisoner
at once to one of the strongest castles in his dominions,
namely Falaise. Arthur was now between fourteen
and fifteen years of age, and John, reckoning without
that stubborn courage of nature which the boy
inherited, attempted to make him abdicate his rights,
in vain. Finding this hopeless, he hurried him away
to Rouen, there to dispose of him finally. Arthur’s
incarceration at Falaise is dealt with in the chapter
on Falaise, and his captivity at Rouen is treated in
the chapter on Rouen. The fury of the Bretons, who
saw the last of their ruling race, a promising boy,
thus foully murdered by the duke of the Normans,
their life-long foes, may be imagined; it hardly needed
the French king’s call to arms to make them rise in
their wrath and flood in upon the neighbouring
towns of Normandy. The conduct of John after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
this displays a pitiable weakness. He alone of all
the Conqueror’s line showed a lack of courage; others
had been weak, vacillating, unfilial, cruel, vicious,
but it remained for John to combine all these qualities
in himself. His movements were like those of a
timid animal who knows the huntsmen are closing
in on him, but has not courage to make a dash
through the ring. He hurried from Rouen to Caen,
from Caen to Brix, and Brix to Valognes. Back
again to Caen, and then to Domfront. He returned
to the Côtentin, and at last embarked at Barfleur
without striking a blow to save that land, which he
had not hesitated to gain by murdering a boy, when
he thought there was no personal danger in the action.
He did indeed return in 1206 for a short time, but
never in such a spirit as to make the retrieving of his
dominions possible. Meantime the Normans did
not submit so quietly; they could not endure the
entry of the Bretons, and sternly defended themselves
at Mont St Michel, which was set on fire, and at
Caen; but it was of no use; the Bretons, after a
triumphal progress, met the French king, who had
received the submission of Caen as well as Lisieux
and Bayeux, and thus with hardly a struggle there
fell into the hands of France that territory which she
had so long and so jealously regarded. If ever a king
deserved to lose his land, it was the craven John.</p>

<div id="ip_32" class="figcenter" style="width: 485px;"><img src="images/i_076.jpg" width="485" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">A STREET, MONT ST MICHEL</div></div>

<p>By a curious oversight in the ratification and the
submission which followed this conquest, the Channel
Islands were overlooked. It has been suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
they were simply forgotten; if so, the event proved
fortunate for them, for they have remained ever
since in the happy independence granted them by
England. The title of Duke of Normandy was
dropped by Henry III., John’s son, at the Treaty
of Saintes in 1259, when it was agreed that
Acquitaine should remain an English possession,
and the title was afterwards borne by a scion of
the ruling French house. But the tale of Normandy’s
wars is not ended. For in the time of Edward,
that monarch was set upon recovering not only the
territory lost by his grandfather, but, if possible,
the French crown for himself; he landed at Barfleur,
and, quickly subduing the Côtentin, passed on to
St Lo, Coutances, and Caen, taking towns and
seizing vast quantities of precious stuffs wherever
he went. These triumphs were followed by the
famous battles of Crécy and Poitiers, and the historic
siege of Calais. However, his conquest left no
permanent mark on Normandy, for by the Treaty
of Bretigny in 1360, though he received much else,
he resigned Normandy with his claim to the French
crown, and it was reserved for his great-grandson,
Henry V., to recover the duchy by the sword. This he
actually did, after a brilliant series of victories; so
that in the years 1417 and 1418 Normandy became
an appanage of the English crown, but under the rule
of the weak Henry VI. his father’s conquests lapsed,
and by 1450 Normandy was once more included in
the dominions of France, never again to be severed.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE MIGHTY WILLIAM</span></h2>

<p>William’s father was the fifth Duke of Normandy,
and if the story of how he attained that dignity be
true, certain it is that his nickname “Le Diable” was
more fitting than the other, “Magnifique,” which
he earned by his lavishness. His elder brother,
Richard, was Duke of Normandy when Robert
set up the standard of rebellion at Falaise. But
Richard was no weakling, and did not suffer the
disaffection to spread; he appeared before the walls
with all the forces at his disposal, and soon compelled
his younger brother to sue for peace. Then
an arrangement was made by which a certain grant
of land was conferred on the rebel, while the castle
of Falaise, a powerful stronghold, was recognised
as the property of the reigning duke. To celebrate
the occasion the two brothers repaired in amity
to Rouen, and there in the castle fortress, then
standing on the site of the markets near the river,
a banquet was held, to cement the new friendship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
and understanding. But suddenly Richard turned
pale and sickened, and before nightfall he was dead.
There was little doubt that poison had been in his
cup; put there by whom but the man who was
now duke, and held the power of life and death in
his hands! None dare speak to accuse him, and,
like many another in the Dark Ages, he reaped the
full reward of his crime in perfect security. There
were others of his family alive, uncles as powerful,
and, had occasion arisen, doubtless as unscrupulous
as himself; but Robert was on the spot, he held
possession, and apparently without a word being
raised in protest, he occupied his murdered brother’s
place. An illegitimate son of his brother’s, named
Nicholas, he placed in the abbey at Fécamp to be
trained as a monk, a method often made use of by
half savage kings to soften youthful rivals, still
susceptible of being taught the hollowness of
worldly ambition and the wickedness of rebellion
against authority. It may be thought that this
youth can hardly have been regarded as a serious
rival, but in those days the marriage-tie was not
deemed essential to inheritance. From William
Longsword every Norman duke so far had been
born out of wedlock, and though they had been
legitimatised afterwards by some ceremony between
their parents, this was rather a concession than a
necessity. It is said that Nicholas entered with
zest into his holy vocation, and was himself the
architect of the first church of St Ouen at Rouen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
of which there remains only the beautiful apse,
known as the Tour aux Clercs. He was fourth
abbot, and was buried in the church.</p>

<div id="ip_36" class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"><img src="images/i_084.jpg" width="700" height="511" alt="" /><div class="caption">HARBOUR OF FÉCAMP</div></div>

<p>What always strikes one as remarkable in reading
history, is the youth of the principal actors. Robert
was but twenty-two when he murdered his brother
for the ducal crown. Falaise was one of his
favourite seats, the hunting was good, the country
pleasant, and the security of the stronghold reassuring.
Once, as he returned from hunting, he had
espied a tanner’s daughter, of rare beauty, washing
clothes in the little stream that runs beneath the
mighty rock; when he looked out of the high
narrow window the next day, he had no difficulty
in recognising the same girl again; and subsequently
he introduced himself to her in the guise of a lover.
Tanning was looked upon by the Normans as
being a very low trade indeed, and though Fulbert,
the Conqueror’s grandsire, added to it the avocation
of brewing, he could never shake off the odium
which clung to his name on account of his principal
business. The base-born brat of the tanner’s
daughter would hardly be considered at first as
even a pawn in the great game of statecraft. But
the boy was dear to his father’s heart. His mother,
Arlotta, was taken into the castle, and there was
none to rival her, for Robert was not married.
Yet strangely enough he did not make her his
wife, and so render brighter the prospects of the
sturdy boy, whom he regarded with much affection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
He could not bring himself to recognise Arlotta
even by the sort of ceremony his ancestors had
considered sufficient; his pride was too great to
give the tanner’s daughter a right to share his
throne, and he preferred that his son should start
more heavily weighted for the race than he need
have been. When Robert made up his mind to go
on a crusade to the Holy Land, the position became
one of great difficulty; he was worse than childless,
and men began dimly to foresee that this only son
of his would prove a heavy stumbling-block in the
way of any other succession. But Robert’s selfishness
being immeasurably stronger than his paternal
love, he departed, leaving it to be well understood
that in case of accidents William was to be his
heir. But there were a number of the descendants of
the great Rollo still alive, strong men, soldiers,
nobles with retinues of their own, and each and all
put his own claim prior to that of this nameless
boy. Looked at thus, it seems little short of
miraculous that William should ever have raised
himself to the throne at all, a more wonderful feat
than even his conquest of England in later years.
The boy was but eight when, after various warning
rumours of failing health, the news came definitely
that his father was dead. Duke Robert had left
him in charge of Alain, Count of Brittany, who,
though a relative, could not himself hope to ascend
the throne, and the choice was wise. Alain fulfilled
his trust loyally, and the exceptional talent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
courage of the young duke seem from the first to
have attached to him a number of nobles, so that
his position gradually gained solidarity, though the
marvel that he should have escaped knife or poison
in an age where such means of riddance were frequently
employed remains the same. Full credit
for his safety at this dangerous time must be given
to the nobles of the Côtentin, especially to Neel of
St Sauveur, who is mentioned again in the chapter
on that district. The bitterness of the stain upon
his birth was early felt by William, and there are
instances in his career which point to the smarting
of a hidden sore shown by a man ordinarily self-possessed.
His treatment of the burghers of
Alençon, because they had openly taunted him with
his birth, is one case in point; the other is his own
unexampled domestic life, which stands out in
strong contrast with those of his predecessors; he
seems early to have made up his mind with iron
will that what he had suffered through his father,
none should suffer through him.</p>

<p>At thirteen he took upon himself responsibility,
and really began to rule. His mother had been
separated from him, and had no share in the
government. She had married a knight named
Herlouin, by whom she had two children, of both
of whom we hear much in history. The elder,
Odo, became Bishop of Bayeux. He it was who
encouraged his half-brother’s troops at Hastings,
going before and calling them on. As Odo’s dealings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
had more to do with England than Normandy, we
may dispose of him here in a few words. After the
Conquest, vast wealth and many estates were
bestowed upon him; he was viceroy in William’s
absence, and second in power to the king himself.
His overweening pride made him overbearing; he
aspired to sit on the papal throne. William, discovering
in him many treasonable practices, kept him
prisoner at Rouen. On his half-brother’s death,
however, he once more became prominent, led
insurrections against his nephew William the Red,
and joined with Duke Robert in his fraternal wars.
At last this turbulent, vigorous, astute man went
crusading with Robert, and died at Palermo in
1097.</p>

<p>Arlotta’s other son, Robert of Mortain, was a
loyal brother; he prepared a hundred and twenty
ships for the great flotilla, and lived peaceably during
the Conqueror’s lifetime, though he too warred against
William the Red. He is mentioned again in connection
with Mortain.</p>

<p>The generally received opinion of William the
Conqueror in England is, that he was a stern and
cruel man; stern he certainly was, stern with the
sternness of strength which serves as a shield
against familiarity, and enables its possessor to go
straight on his own way, regardless of unfavourable
opinions or specious arguments.</p>

<p>“This King William that we speak about,” says
the chronicler, “was a very wise man, and very rich;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
more worshipful and strong than any of his foregangers
were. He was mild to the good men that
loved God, and beyond all metes stark to them who
withstood his will. Else, he was very worshipful.”
This is the testimony of one who was almost his
contemporary, and who had nothing to fear from
him, nor aught to gain by praising him.</p>

<p>The idea of William’s cruelty is based on his
harrying of Northumberland, an act that could never
have originated in the mind of a soft-hearted or
imaginative man; but William’s bent was not toward
cruelty, and considering the age in which he lived, the
well-authenticated cases which we have of his clemency
are remarkable. When he was only twenty, an age
when if there be any hardness in a man’s nature it
is at its worst, unsoftened by personal experience of
sorrow, he spared the lives of those of his vassals who
had risen against him not openly but with treachery.
The manner of it was thus. Guy of Burgundy,
William’s first cousin, entered into a conspiracy with
many of the most powerful nobles of Normandy to
assassinate the duke. It is easy to be seen what was
Guy’s motive; though he could only claim through
his mother, he meant to make himself Duke of
Normandy; but it is more difficult to see what the
others expected to gain by a move which proposed to
substitute one duke for another. It was not the first
time that rebellion and revolt against the duke had
risen, but it was the most serious plot, and the turning-point
of William’s career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
So secretly had the conspiracy been planned that
he was all unaware of it. He was at this time in his
twentieth year, and, as Wace tells us, “the barons’
feuds continued; they had no regard for him;
everyone according to his means made castles and
fortresses.” Up till now William had lived, but he
had not been master. “Affrays and jealousies,
maraudings and challengings” had continued in spite
of him, but this deadly conspiracy was to bring
matters to a head in a way its projectors little
thought. William was in the castle of Alleaumes
close to Valognes; he had retired for the night, when
he was awakened by the agonised entreaties of the
court fool, who told him that the nobles were even
now on the point of arriving in order to seize him
unprepared, and murder him. William must have
had great confidence in his jester, for he rose straightway,
and apparently without waiting for attendants
saddled his horse, and rode off into the dark night.
The whole story is mysterious; were there then no
men-at-arms to guard the duke, no attendant to go
with him? would it not have been safer to barricade
the castle rather than to have fled alone? Whatever
the cause, William’s midnight ride is a matter of
history. There were no smooth, easy roads then; the
country, from various accounts in charters and deeds
of the tenth century, was covered with woods, and
much waste ground; and, as we know, wolves
abounded, for much later (1326), forty-five wolves
were taken in the district of Coutances, twenty-two in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
that of Carentan, and nineteen in that of Valognes, in
the Easter term alone. The young duke could only
have had the stars to guide him, and safety was far
off. He meant to get to Falaise, where he could
feel tolerably secure; but even as the crow flies
Falaise is over seventy miles from Valognes, and the
way would be difficult to find. The account of this
dramatic episode is circumstantially given by the old
chronicler, who tells us that even as William left the
town he heard the clatter of the enemies’ horses
entering it. The enemy, finding he had fled, and
knowing they had implicated themselves far too
deeply to think of pardon, set off in hot pursuit, and
the duke was only saved by hiding in a thicket,
whence he saw them go by. He did not follow the
direct route, but kept along by the sea-coast, until the
next morning on a worn and jaded steed he found
himself at Ryes, between Bayeux and the coast,
where he revealed himself to the lord of the manor-house,
a man named Hubert. Hubert promptly
rehorsed him, and sent him on his way with two of
his own sons as guides. Thus the duke managed to
reach the stronghold of Falaise in safety.</p>

<p>Later on William constructed a raised road,
running through the country in the direction of his
flight; it ran from Valognes to Bayeux and thence to
Falaise, part of it may still be seen between Quilly-le-Tessin,
Caitheoux, and Fresni-le-Pucceux. It is said
that it was the forced task of the very conspirators who
had compelled the fight, an instance of grim justice!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
The malcontents must have trembled when they
knew that their powerful overlord was free, and fully
aware of their guilt; there was no escape now, open
revolt was their only chance, so they gathered their
forces and attacked Caen.</p>

<p>William, for his part, collected his men, and
leaving a garrison in Falaise, marched to Rouen;
but too much depended on a battle, to risk it
against a greatly superior and better prepared
force. He resolved on a stroke of policy, no less
than to call for protection from his own overlord
the King of France, who had formerly been his
invader and enemy. King Henry responded to the
appeal, possibly feeling that Normandy might slip
from him altogether, and France itself be menaced,
were the handful of nobles to win power by their
swords.</p>

<p>Then was fought, at Val-ès-dunes, about nine
miles from Caen, one of the most memorable
battles in the history of Normandy.</p>

<p>A picturesque incident marked the beginning of
the battle. A splendid company of knights, carrying
devices on their lances, were seen in the forefront
of the nobles’ ranks, and William, advancing, cried
out that they were his friends. The leader, De
Gesson, was so much touched by this, that though
he had banded himself with the insurgents, and
taken a fearful oath to be the first to strike
William in the <i>mêlée</i>, he satisfied his conscience
by one of those transparent evasions common to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
superstitious ages, and considered he had redeemed
his word by striking William gently on the shoulder
with his gauntlet, and then immediately transferring
himself and his followers to the side against which
he had come out to fight.</p>

<p>It is said the army of the nobles numbered
20,000, but figures seen through such a distance
of time have generally suffered from a little extension.
The fight was fierce, and hand to hand;
battle-axes and swords played greater part than
arrows. It is impossible to better the picturesque
account given by Wace. “There was great stir
over the field, horses were to be seen curvetting,
the pikes were raised, the lances brandished, and
shields and helmets glistened. As they gallop they
cry their various war-cries: those of France cry
‘Montjoie!’ the sound whereof is pleasant to them.
William cries ‘Dex Aie!’ the swords are drawn,
the lances clash. Many were the vassals to be
seen there fighting, serjeants and knights overthrowing
one another. The king himself was
struck and beat down off his horse.”</p>

<div id="ip_44" class="figcenter" style="width: 455px;"><img src="images/i_096.jpg" width="455" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">A ROAD NEAR ROUEN</div></div>

<p>But in the end William and his ally triumphed,
and the nobles fled in confusion from the field.
Yet, when he seized the arch-traitor Guy of
Burgundy, he treated him as we have said with
extraordinary leniency, and except for taking from
him the territory which had enabled him to play
such a part, he suffered him to go unpunished, and
even provided for him otherwise. This treatment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
bore fruit, for Guy became a good subject, and led
troops at Hastings with distinction. The other
leaders were deprived of their estates, and one was
imprisoned, but none were executed, while the
smaller men escaped scot-free. When the duke
had come to his full stature he was a mighty man,
some say seven feet in height, and unwieldy in bulk;
none could wield his axe; in battle, horse and man
went down before him, cloven by the strength of
his mighty arm. And not alone in strength was he
more than a match for his fellows, but let a man as
much as whisper treason, and he heard of it; those
who plotted were reached surely by that penetrating
power, and lived to rue their folly. He was a
kingly man, born to rule.</p>

<p>But though the victory at Val-ès-dunes made
him duke <i>de facto</i>, his work was far from being
done, insurrection continued in other parts of the
duchy, and shortly after he was called to subdue
Alençon, which held out against him. “He found
the inhabitants all ready to greet him: calthrops
sown, fosses deepened, walls heightened, palisades
bristling all around ... to spite the Tanner’s grandson,
the walls were tapestried with raw hides, the
filthy gore-besmeared skins hung out, and as he
drew nigh, they whacked them and they thwacked
them; ‘plenty of work for the tanner,’ they sang
out, shouting and hooting, mocking their enemies”
(Palgrave).</p>

<p>Then in an ineffectual sortie some of the townsmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
fell into William’s hands, and terrible was the
vengeance which fell on them for their savage joke.
Their eyes were spiked out, their hands and feet
chopped off, and the mangled limbs were flung into
the town. Soon after, no doubt awed by an anger
so much fiercer than they had reckoned on, a
cruelty so merciless when aroused, the people made
terms, and William, victorious, once again returned
to Rouen.</p>

<div id="ip_46" class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"><img src="images/i_102.jpg" width="700" height="455" alt="" /><div class="caption">NEAR PONT-AUDEMER</div></div>

<p>The next rebel was William’s own uncle, of the
same name as himself, his father’s half-brother.
He trusted to the strength of the castle of Arques,
near Dieppe, which had been given him by his
nephew. But the young duke was in the heyday
of his vigour. The news was brought to him at
Valognes at midday one Thursday, and by Friday
evening he was before the gates of Arques, having
come by way of Bayeux, Caen, and Pont-Audemer.
The castle was stoutly defended, and so impregnable
by position, that the only method was to sit
down before it and wait; a method adopted with
complete success, though the arch-traitor himself
managed to escape and fly. Many other smaller
risings occurred which kept the great Conqueror in
practice, and then came the second great battle
in Normandy, that of Mortèmer, at which he was
not present himself. He had shown his diplomacy
in using the King of France as an ally against the
men of the Côtentin, now it was the same King of
France, Henry, who, being jealous of the power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
this great vassal, fomented insurrection among his
subjects and entered that part of the duchy known
as the Vexin, in a hostile spirit. To the French,
the Normans were even yet pirates, and pirates
they continued to be called until the end. Wace
says that the Frenchmen would call the Normans
“Bigoz,” a corruption of their war-cry, “By God,”
from which comes our word bigot; and they would
ask the king, “Sire, why do you not chase the
Bigoz out of the country? Their ancestors were
robbers, who came by sea, and stole the land from
our forefathers and us.”</p>

<p>So the French marched as far as Mortèmer, and
began to pillage. But after pillage came revelry,
as it so frequently does, and the Normans, who had
been watchful but unseen, fell upon the French and
routed them hip and thigh. With the blithe
exaggeration of days before statistics were known,
the old chronicler says, “nor was there a prison in
all Normandy which was not full of the Frenchmen.
They were to be seen fleeing around, skulking
in the woods and bushes, and the dead and
wounded lay amid the burning ruins, and upon
the dunghills, and about the fields, and in the
bye-paths.”</p>

<p>As we have said, at this battle William personally
was not present, and the French king was not taken
prisoner.</p>

<p>Record states that William broke into poetry,
apparently the only time he was so seized: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
very words of his poem are preserved; here is a
verse of <span class="locked">it:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Réveillez vous et vous levez<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guerriers qui trop dormi avez<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Allez bientôt voir vos amys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que les Normands ont à mort mys<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Là les vous convient les inhumer.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>After this, negotiations were concluded, and the
French prisoners restored; nevertheless the French
again soon after entered Normandy, and ravaged
the country, even so far as the coast. The River
Dive, lying to the east of Caen, is considered the
dividing line between Upper and Lower Normandy,
and it was at this river that William came up
with the main body of the French, including the
king himself. William’s strokes generally owed as
much to their policy as their strength, and this
time was no exception. He waited in ambush until
half the French had crossed the stream, and then
falling suddenly on the remainder, cut them off, and
totally routed them. Those in advance, taken in
the rear, fled in confusion, and vast quantities of
spoil fell into the duke’s hands, though the French
king himself escaped. After this, peace was concluded
at Fécamp.</p>

<p>But still fighting did not cease. The Counts
of Anjou had been a perpetual thorn in William’s
side, and the most formidable of all was Geoffrey
Martel, who seized Maine, and held it as well as
his own territory; but buoyant with victory, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Norman troops advanced upon the principal city,
Le Mans, and took it without difficulty, and
Geoffrey Martel was quieted for a while; he died
four years before the Conquest of England.</p>

<p>But now we must turn for a moment from
William’s battles to his domestic life. His romantic
marriage is an outstanding incident in his career.
He did not marry until he was twenty-six, a considerable
age for a king. But in that as in other
matters he had a mind of his own, and one lady
and one only would satisfy him, and she kept him
waiting for seven years. She was his own first
cousin, Matilda of Flanders, daughter of Baldwin
V., Earl of Flanders, but neither she nor her
relatives cared for the match. There are various
tales concerning her, one of which says she was
already a widow when William expressed his
preference, and had two children of her own.
Another story says she favoured another suitor,
who, however, was perhaps well advised in declining
the perilous position of husband to the lady of
William’s choice, however flattering that lady’s
preference for himself. After waiting with more
or less patience for seven years, William took
summary methods. He went to Bruges, where
his ladylove lived, and meeting her as she returned
from church, rolled her in the mud of the street,
humiliating her in the eyes of all, and ruining her
gay and beautiful clothes. This Petruchio-like
method served the purpose. In a very short time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Matilda consented to marry the man who had
shown her his determination in so unequivocal a
manner. This particular marriage seems to have
been a brilliant exception in an age when marriage
vows were held in scant respect. Yet, when he
won Matilda’s consent, all William’s troubles, in
regard to the alliance, were by no means at an
end. By the tenets of the Church to which he and
his bride belonged, they were within the prohibited
degree of consanguinity. This difficulty was surmounted
by their gaining absolution on the condition
that they erected two religious houses at Caen,
houses which stand to this day, and are mentioned
more particularly in the chapter on that city.</p>

<p>It was two years before his marriage that William
had paid that celebrated visit to England in which
had probably originated his intention to become
lord of that country in due time. But it was not
until he was thirty-six that he received the return
visit from Harold, when he extorted from his unwilling
guest the oath on which he based his right
to the English throne. The story of Harold and
of the Conquest is told in connection with the
famous tapestry, one of the most marvellous contemporary
records ever a nation possessed. We
resume the narrative here when William, as King
of England, in March 1067 returned to Normandy,
bringing with him the harmless Edgar Atheling,
also the earls Edwin and Morcar, and the archbishop
Stigand, probably less with the intention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
treating them as guests than with the idea of leaving
no head for a revolt behind him in his new country.
He held festivals at Rouen, Caen, Fécamp, and
Falaise, a kind of triumphal progress in fact; and
then returning to quell the revolts which had broken
out in England in his absence, he took with him
Matilda, and they were jointly crowned at Westminster.
But his triumphs were soon to be dimmed
by sore domestic worry. During his frequent
absences in England he left Matilda in charge of
Normandy, and with her he associated his son
Robert. But Robert was rude and unfilial; he
grasped at power on his own account, and his
mother, with that weak affection so often shown in
a mother toward her first-born son, aided and
sympathised with him. One great source of quarrel
between the young prince and his father was the
government of the country of Maine. Robert had
been affianced to the young Countess of Maine,
who had died before the marriage; he held, therefore,
that he ought now to rule there independently, while
William, who had subdued the country by his sword
before he took possession of the young heiress and
betrothed her to his son, held it for himself, and
the subject was the cause of endless recrimination
between the king and his eldest son. Besides
Robert, he had had three other sons, but the next,
Richard, “had been killed in some mysterious
manner, which seemed to make people loath to
speak even of the circumstance” (Palgrave). He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
seems to have met his death in the New Forest,
where also were killed William the Red and one
of Robert’s sons. William, afterwards known as
Rufus, was six years his eldest brother’s junior,
and Henry was several years younger still. There
were also, at ages varying between the brothers,
five daughters. Cecily, of whom we hear at Caen,
as first abbess of her mother’s foundation; she
became eventually Abbess of Fécamp. Constance,
married to the Duke of Brittany. Adeliza or Agatha,
first betrothed to Harold, and afterwards, much
against her will, to the King of Galicia; but she
was never married to him, dying on the journey to
Spain. Adela, who married Stephen of Blois, and
whose son afterwards became king of England; and
Alice, who died young. Others add Constance and
Adelaide, but five daughters and four sons are
enough for any man, and the existence of the other
two seems mythical. Various insurrections and
petty wars vexed William’s later days, but still his
hand was strong, his courage unfailing. He forgave
his eldest son’s disloyalty more than once, only to
find it break out again. At last, after wandering in
exile for several years, Robert fixed himself in the
castle of Gerberoi, on French soil, whence William
assailed him, having his two younger sons with him.
In one of the desperate sallies of the besieged, father
and son engaged in a hand-to-hand conflict, and
being disguised by heavy armour, neither knew the
other. At length William, being wounded, cried out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
and in a moment his son, struck by remorse, raised
his visor and fell on his knees asking forgiveness,
sobered by the thought of the terrible crime of
patricide of which he had nearly been guilty.
Yet the reconciliation was hollow, and the father
and son were never at heart friends. It was nine
years after this that the end came. Philip, now King
of France, seized an opportunity to make inroads on
Normandy, and a mocking speech of his about
William, who had grown corpulent and unwieldy,
was repeated to the English king. But his spirit
was the same; embittered by personal troubles, lonely
in the estrangement and loss of her who had been
his faithful companion through life, though not old
in years&mdash;for he was only sixty&mdash;yet old with the
turmoil of a fierce, hard life lived from the cradle, he
still had the fire of youth, and he returned a furious
answer to Philip’s taunt.</p>

<p>“The harvest was ripening, the grape swelling
on the stem, the fruit reddening on the bough,”
when William entered the fertile land where he was
to meet with death. He seized the town of Mantes,
belonging to the French king, and soon the place
was in red ruin. A mass of flames mounted high
in the sky, the inhabitants lay wounded to death or
fled in terror, and the king himself, in spite of his
great bulk and increasing infirmity, superintended the
work of destruction; then suddenly&mdash;one has heard
the story from earliest childhood&mdash;his fine charger,
treading unexpectedly on a hot cinder, started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
violently, and flung its rider violently against the
high-peaked saddle of the country&mdash;William had
received his death-blow. There was little left to
follow. He was carried by easy stages to his capital
city, Rouen, and there laid in the abbey of St
Gervais. And we may read of his lonely end in the
account of the city of Rouen. But even after his
death, the solitude which had attended the end did
not desert him; of all historical funerals ever recorded,
that of this great man is the most terrible.</p>

<p>The body was conveyed at the cost of a private
citizen on its journey to Caen. Some say that his
youngest son Henry followed it to Caen, but it seems
hardly likely, for in that case there would have been
no need for a subject to defray the expenses, as he
undoubtedly did. The corpse was taken to the
church in the abbey of St Etienne&mdash;the abbey that,
so light-heartedly years before, William had erected
in penance for his marriage. Yet the mischances
were not at an end. As the procession passed along
the narrow street, a cry arose that the town was
on fire. Down went the bier, and off went the
crowd in search of this new sensation. It was not
until the fire was quenched that the funeral was
resumed. As they prepared with all due solemnity
to lower the body into the grave, one stepped forward,
crying, “I adjure ye that ye inter not William in
the spot where ye are about to lay him. He shall
not commit trespass on what is my right, for the
greater part of this church is my right and of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
fee, and I have no greater right in any of my
lands.... By force he took it from me, and never
afterwards offered to do me right.” He who had
never dared to rebuke William publicly for “offering
that which cost him nothing,” after his death was
very bold. “All marvelled that this great king,
who had conquered so much, and won so many
cities and so many castles, could not call so much
land his own as his body might lie within after
death.”</p>

<p>The claimant was appeased by money, and after
a further mishap too terrible to relate, those who
had fulfilled their duty left the body of the king.</p>

<p>But even then his dust was not suffered to rest
in peace, for in 1562 his tomb was broken into by
the Huguenots, and again by the mob in 1793, and
the remains disturbed. All that was preserved was
a thigh-bone, a mighty bone, showing by its measurements
the size and strength of the man, and this
was reburied, and now lies before the altar, where
a long inscription records the burial-place. It is
the same as the original epitaph, though new cut:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hic</span> Sepultus est invictissimus Guillelemus Conquestor
Normanniae Dux, et Anglae Rex Hujus ce
domus conditor qui obiit Anno MLXXXVII.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="subhead">A MEDIÆVAL CITY</span></h2>

<p>Rouen is surrounded by high hills, and can be
seen lying on the margin of the river in the
aspect of a toy city. In this there lies one great
advantage, namely, that she is not easy to forget.
Perhaps the remembrance of any place is sharpened
more by having seen it whole than by any other
circumstance. If this be impossible, one’s mental
pictures are often blurred or only partial. Into
what, for instance, does the remembrance of Caen
resolve itself? Fragmentary peeps, or at best,
the view from the railway, where the town is seen
on edge, a thin line, above which spires rise
irregularly. At the mention of the word Rouen, on
the contrary, what a vision leaps up in the mind, a
wonderful glittering picture of spires and bridges, of
shining water, and piled house-roofs, of islands and
tall chimneys!</p>

<p>France has an excellent plan of tucking away her
chimneys and other unsightly commercial accessories
on one side of a river, leaving her residential quarter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
free from smoke; so it is here. To southward, in the
Faubourg or suburb of St Sever, lie the working
quarters, with all the smoke&mdash;which, however, never
seems so smoky as in England&mdash;the noise and din of
men who manufacture. On the islands, as in an
intermediate quarter, are the houses of the workmen,
and on the northern shore is the grand old city.</p>

<p>We have spoken previously of the difficulty of
putting on paper the soul, character, entity&mdash;call it
what you will&mdash;of a country, and the same thing holds
good of a city; but in the case of such a city as
Rouen, how is the difficulty increased! There is one
obvious note, however, which must strike anyone at
once, and that is that the town is French, not
Norman&mdash;thoroughly French; and the difference
between it and the towns further westward, if not so
marked as in the days when little Richard of
Normandy was sent to be educated at Bayeux, is
still noticeable. The modern houses are, of course,
severely French, the people in the streets are French,
the shops are French, and the whole tone of the life
is French altogether.</p>

<p>Secondly, Rouen is, as might be expected, a
city of contrasts, the broad boulevards have cut
deeply into her, but the change is superficial, not
radical, she is still to all intents an ancient city,&mdash;a
mediæval city to which a certain trimming of the
latest fashion has been added. Electric trams run
along the boulevards, but the parts between the
boulevards remain mediæval. Let anyone who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
doubts it go to a topmost room in a block of
buildings, say between the Rue Jeanne d’Arc and
Rue de la Republique, and, craning his neck out, “see
what he will see,”&mdash;a grotesque and curious
medley of chimneys, leaning walls, slanting house-roofs,
and old-fashioned projecting stories, mingled
in an inextricable fashion. The crooked buildings
seem to have grown on to one another and stuck
there, in the manner of cowries and periwinkles on a
rock. There is hardly a line exactly horizontal or
perpendicular; it is difficult to tell where one house
begins or the other ends; to pull down one would be
to have all the others tumbling about one’s ears.
High up are tiny platforms with doors opening on to
them; the roofs are broken by many a quaint dormer
window; the whole could only be swept away by a
great fire, such as came to London in 1666. Then
above and about these roofs and gables and angles
rise wonderful towers containing some of the best
work that man has done: the towers of the great
Cathedral, or one of the famous churches.</p>

<div id="ip_58" class="figcenter" style="width: 451px;"><img src="images/i_118.jpg" width="451" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">OLD HOUSES, ROUEN</div></div>

<p>There are streets in Rouen which might have
come straight from mediæval London. Such is the
Rue St Romain, near the Cathedral. Here there are
rows and rows of timber framed, heavily projecting
houses with small quaint windows. In a courtyard
beneath the very shadow of the Cathedral is a delightful
row, with a carved stone parapet running across
the frontage, and the oddest mixture of lines and
angles and irregular windows ever seen out of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
picture. In almost every side street may be found
traces of the ancient city. In one corner there are
grotesque figures carved on the supports of a house
bowed out with age, in another we see suddenly a bit
of stone carving, worn and defaced with continual
rubbing, where the women of Rouen fill their cans at
a fountain as their mothers and grandmothers have
done before them. Here a low dark arch like a
cathedral crypt is used as a small vegetable shop,
and in it a pleasant blue-bloused man and comely
woman pass their time contentedly though their
heads nearly touch the roof; there an arcade betrays
what has once been a chapel, but is now a yard filled
with lumbering omnibuses. One of the most delicate
and fanciful of frontages, belonging to an old house,
was preserved at the time of the demolition which
took place at the making of the Rue Jeanne d’Arc,
and re-erected beside the Tower of St André, of
which the body, by the way, was sheared off at the
same epoch. It has often been overlooked, this
pretty bit of work, which must have occupied a man’s
time and thoughts and skill for many months,
because it does not face the street, and is partly
concealed by the church tower. A tiny bit of railed-in
garden&mdash;that is to say, some gravel and a couple
of seats&mdash;surround the tower, and even this wee
spot has its “gardien” to accompany visitors to the
summit, if they wish to ascend.</p>

<p>For its size, Rouen has singularly few of those
open spaces of greenery, those charming public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
gardens, which, as a rule, form one of the best
features of a French town. There is a little public
garden to the east, and Solferino is certainly delightful
with big shady trees and a neat bit of water;
but it is small. There is also the garden to the
east of St Ouen and the Hotel de Ville, but the
combined area is not great. In the streets of
Rouen, too, there are few trees. We see none
of those bright bursts of greenery overhanging walls
unexpectedly, and telling of quiet gardens within
enclosing gates, that one finds frequently elsewhere;
it is a towny town.</p>

<p>The chief jewel of Rouen is of course the
Cathedral, which in its bewildering variety and
transition of styles, has a character of its own
sufficient to stamp it permanently on the memory.
I confess that to me personally, variety has an
infinite charm; I remember far more readily and
with greater appreciation a building where the slow
growth throughout ages has ensured variety, than
one where absolute harmony proclaims its completion
to the pattern of a plan. After all, nothing in
nature is uniformly monotonous; we do not see an
oak or an elm with boughs at precise angles on
each side, and the trees, such as the poplar, which
approach most nearly to uniformity, are by no means
the most beautiful.</p>

<p>The strange unlikeness of the two towers, and
the centre tower crowned by the iron <i>flèche</i>, is
sufficient to ensure attention from the most casual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
observer. One of the western towers has fretwork
windows, bossy pinnacles, and an octagonal coronet;
and the other is much less beautiful, and has
less decorative lines, terminating in the ugly, high,
slate-roofed gable tower. Yet it is better than if
it had conformed; the two together are perfect.
The plainer one to the north is the Tour de St
Romain, which dates from the twelfth to the fifteenth
century, though with considerably more of the earlier
date. The other is called the Tour de Beurre,
because built from the produce of the sale of indulgences
to eat butter in Lent. It bears its date,
namely, the latter half of the fifteenth century, in
every line of its decoration.</p>

<p>We wonder what the ancient church that stood
on this site in the tenth century was like; massive
and grand no doubt, carrying out in stone the
character of its founder Rollo, who was baptised in
it before its completion, receiving the name of
Robert. The edifice was not finished for many
generations, and when it was, a grand ceremony
took place in which Rollo’s great descendant William
figured. But a hundred and fifty years later, when
Henry II. held Normandy and England, this church
was destroyed by fire.</p>

<p>The rebuilding was begun very shortly afterwards,
and the main part of the mighty fabric as
we see it dates from then. The main part&mdash;but
each succeeding century added something, stamping
its hall mark on its style, so that one may say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
here is the work of the fourteenth century, here the
fifteenth, here the sixteenth, and&mdash;in the iron
<i>flèche</i> rising high and not ungracefully&mdash;here the
nineteenth.</p>

<p>The decorated frontage with its three doors was
considered by Ruskin the most exquisite piece of
Flamboyant work existing. The intricacies of the
detail are inexhaustible; and above the centre rises
a fine wheel window of the type that mediæval
craftsmen loved.</p>

<p>But there are other doorways rich in detail also.
Of these the northern, the “Portail des Libraires,”
was so-called because the courtyard before it was
once filled with booksellers’ shops, in the same way
as the space round our own old St Paul’s in London.
This is a most impressive entrance, and the innumerable
sculptured figures which decorate it are representative
of Ovid’s Metamorphoses. It was begun
in 1280 and finished in 1470. The southern door
has also its own name: it is the Portail de la
Calende.</p>

<p>The great drawback to the Cathedral is the
difficulty of seeing it at a “middle” distance. From
afar it rears itself with splendid majesty over the
house roofs, but nearer it is too much hemmed in
and enclosed by houses. One has no place to stand
in such a position as to see it in right perspective.</p>

<div id="ip_62" class="figcenter" style="width: 456px;"><img src="images/i_126.jpg" width="456" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">A STREET IN ROUEN</div></div>

<p>The interior is graceful enough, and the delicate
arcade running round choir and transepts is attractive.
One great defect, which at the same time is a curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
feature, is the cutting in two of the nave arches by
a sort of false story with a second and shorter arch
over the primary one. The effect is unpleasing and
inharmonious. How infinitely more graceful the
arcades would have been if allowed to rise to their
natural height, may be gathered from the instances
in the side aisles.</p>

<p>The dust of Rollo and William Longsword lie
within the great walls, while an empire mightier than
ever their wildest dreams foreshadowed, governed
by their descendant, covers half the earth, and its
sons and daughters come to do homage at the cradle
of their kings. There is here also the heart of
Richard Cœur de Lion, though Richard himself lies
at Fontevrault.</p>

<p>The churches in Rouen are almost innumerable,
and in many, notably St Patrice and St Vincent,
the glory of the old stained glass in the windows
is a great attraction. But out of all the two which
every visitor goes to see are St Maclou and St Ouen.
St Maclou is quite small, but no one who has seen,
under favourable conditions, its curious convex western
façade will ever forget it. The fine, deeply recessed
doorways, with their magnificent carved doors, are
unique. The stonework is like lace; and the stone
is of that variety which shows artificial shadows in
its stains. The whole appearance is so original, so
unlike the conventional western façade, that the
beauty is heightened by the rarity which tends to
emphasise the impression. The interior is disappointing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
and there is a mass of metal high over the altar,
which looks as if it might suddenly descend, and
cause ruin to all beneath. St Ouen is the fifth
church on the same site. It can be observed at
leisure from the green garden that lines its sides,
and it is wonderful, with its coronet tower and flying
buttresses. It was built in the first half of the
fourteenth century and restored in 1846, when the
western façade was added; and if possible it is better
to make a <i>détour</i> to avoid the western façade, or the
memory of an almost perfect piece of work will be
blurred. It was in the garden beside St Ouen that
two scaffolds were erected on the 24th of May 1431.
On one was placed Joan of Arc, strictly guarded by
armed men, and on the other stood the dignitaries
and judges who had gathered to hear her recantation.
This and her submission she formally made, saying
all that her persecutors wished, but afterwards, having
fallen back into her “errors” and announcing that
saints still visited her and voices spoke mysteriously,
she was adjudged a witch, and condemned to death.</p>

<div id="ip_64" class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;"><img src="images/i_132.jpg" width="454" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">THE TOWERS OF ST OUEN</div></div>

<p>One of the oddest bits of Rouen, and one which
it is to be hoped will be long cherished, is to be
found in the Rue de la Grosse Horloge. The great
clock itself is a marvellous work in gilt, standing on
a low, heavy archway which bestrides the street, as
Temple Bar bestrode Fleet Street before a utilitarian
age hustled it away. In London, the only specimen
of this kind of gateway, suffered to remain over a
public street, is the gateway of St John’s, Clerkenwell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
La Grosse Horloge conceals an older clock of
the fourteenth century, and itself dates from 1529,
when it was put up on the newly completed arch.
The inner part of the arch is highly carved, the chief
figure being the Good Shepherd. Close at hand is
a strongly built and well-designed tower or belfry,
begun in 1389 and finished about a hundred years
later. It contains a deep-toned bell, from which the
hour of curfew sounds sonorously every night. This
bell, whose name is Rouvel, is cherished by the citizens,
as in times of danger and distress they have been
summoned by its tongue echoing over the walls and
roofs for many a hundred years. In 1382 a new
tax on merchandise was imposed by the French
Government, and its first enforcement was demanded
at Rouen. The people rose in revolt, named one
of themselves king, and made him solemnly revoke
the tax. The procession gathered as it went, mockery
turned to riot, blood was shed, and condign punishment
followed. The Duke of Anjou, at the head of
troops, marched in the king’s name to the city to
enforce order, and as it was Rouvel who had called
the men of the city to rebellion, he commanded that
the belfry should be destroyed. So it was; but
the citizens preserved their bell, and very soon after
began building a new tower for him, so Rouvel’s
deep-throated notes still vibrate every night.</p>

<p>It is not however the clock, the arch, and belfry
that constitute this one of the most quaint and
picturesque corners in Rouen, though they all add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
to it. There is also a fountain, begun in 1250, and
decorated with a large stone bas-relief in the reign
of Louis XV. There is a tiny house of carved woodwork
that looks as if it were glued to the wall behind.
There are many other quaint houses near at hand,
and if one had to choose a sample of the old city
one could not do better than select this bit. Take
it as we may see it any day from the western side.
There is the heavy arch, with its sombre shadows
beneath its broad curve; there is the wonderful
glittering clock, which may perhaps catch the rays
of the declining sun. Rising high at the corner is
the solid tower with its cupola. We may people
this background with figures to fancy. A group of
loungers there is sure to be, the men in caps and a
few of them in blouses, though the blouse is not so
ubiquitous in the town as in the country; perhaps
a neat little shopwoman comes tripping by, with her
hair screwed up on the top of her head in a glossy
tight knot; an old country-woman passes her, wearing
a close-fitting coif-like cap, and bearing on her
shoulders a wooden frame from which are suspended
baskets of ripe strawberries. Then out of the darkness
of the arch, starting dazzlingly into the sunshine,
there comes a lithe slim figure, robed from head to
foot in a sheet of white muslin: it is a young girl
returning from her First Communion. The loitering
vendors with barrows stop to look at her, and the
tourists from England, of whom there are sure to
be two or three, for the Hotel du Nord is just the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
other side of the archway, turn to stare also. Such
is a slight sketch of the best-known corner in Rouen.</p>

<p>But besides her mighty Cathedral, her wonderful
churches, her street vistas, and her quaint corners,
Rouen has much to show. We have not yet touched
on her Renaissance palaces, and her historical
memories, to say nothing of the twenty-six other
fountains with which she is credited, and her busy
quays.</p>

<p>To take the Renaissance houses first. There is
a magnificent “hotel,” standing in a part lying west
of the Rue Jeanne d’Arc, which has also a little
group of associations of its own. Here, where the
great iron-bound markets stand, Joan of Arc was
burnt to death, after which her ashes were cast into
the river. In these days when the thought of the
public hanging of a notorious criminal turns us faint
and sick, we can hardly, even in imagination, fancy
a great crowd gathered to watch the agonising torture
and death of an innocent young girl.</p>

<p>It was thought for long that Joan was burnt in
the open space near by the Place de la Pucelle, and
here stands a grotesquely hideous statue of her, the
very epitome of all it should not be; but it is now
fairly certain that the place of her last agony was on
the site of the market. Facing the statue is the
entrance gate of the beautiful house of which we
have spoken, the Hotel Bourgtheroulde, now the
“Bureaux du Comptoir d’Escompte.” The house
was begun in 1486 by Guillaume le Roux, Lord of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Bourgtheroulde, and was decorated by the most
famous of the Renaissance architects, Jean Goujon,
to whom almost as impossible an amount of work
is attributed as to Grinling Gibbons. The decoration
in the courtyard is a splendid example of the
period, and can hardly be overpraised. Under the
five broad windows on the left hand, run large panels,
with scenes of the meeting between François, King
of France, and Henry, King of England; for the
mansion was not finished until 1532, a date when
that meeting was still one of the greatest of political
events. Above the windows the artist has given
his fancy full rein, and in the symbolical scenes and
strange beasts we find a representation of the
“Triumphs” of Petrarch. All the uprights and
lintels of the windows are richly carved. In the
corner is a hexagonal tower, and in this the carving
is in marvellously sharp and clear preservation,
treated with a certain flatness of the most prominent
surface, difficult to describe, but very effective and
original; the scenes are pastoral. There are two
splendid windows on the frontage beyond, rising
into high, pierced pediments, with pinnacles and
tracery, and on this side also is exquisite carving.</p>

<p>The Earl of Shrewsbury was lodged in this house
when he came as Ambassador from Elizabeth to
invest Henri IV. with the Order of the Garter.</p>

<p>Another magnificent example of Renaissance work
in Rouen is the Palais de Justice, begun in 1499, on
the site of the Jewry. It was meant to be partly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Exchequer and partly the Exchange. Unfortunately,
the worst end&mdash;the west end, which is of
eighteenth-century sham Gothic, unmistakably so,
even to the merest novice in architecture&mdash;is that
most frequently seen, as it faces the open space in
the great Rue Jeanne d’Arc, whereas the really fine
court has to be sought for down a side street.</p>

<p>Lying northward, hidden away by houses beyond
the Solferino Garden, not far from the great buildings
of the Musée and the Library, is a solitary relic,
namely, the round tower called Tour Jeanne d’Arc.
It is not very attractive in appearance, being a solid
cylindrical mass of masonry capped by projecting
wooden battlements and a conical slate roof, both of
which were added in restoration. The battlements
are interesting, as they are of the ancient sort,
formed to protect the defenders, who poured down
boiling lead or showered stones upon their attackers.</p>

<p>It was not in this tower, however, that Joan was
kept a prisoner from December 26, 1430, to May 30,
1431, but in another which stood near the top of the
present Rue Jeanne d’Arc. Both of these towers
belonged to the great castle begun by Philip
Augustus in 1205, when he had at last snatched
Normandy from England, and was feverishly anxious
about the safety of his new dominions. Before
beginning his own castle, he destroyed all that
remained of the old castle built by the Norman
dukes, and now his own has followed the same fate,
and has vanished, excepting the Tour Jeanne d’Arc,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
an interesting relic, dating far further back than most
of the ancient buildings we have seen.</p>

<p>Joan was brought to the tower, still standing,
on the 9th of May, for an examination before her
accusers, and the torturer was held in readiness to
prompt her replies did she fail in answering. The
very room in which she stood is here to be seen;
though it was in the chapel of the archbishop, near
the Cathedral, that her death-warrant was signed.
When Joan was in Rouen the oldest of the timber
houses must have been fresh and new, the Palais de
Justice and Hotel Bourgtheroulde had not been
begun. The oldest parts of St Ouen stood, and
St Maclou was incomplete. Could Joan but have
looked on into the future and have seen the finest
street in Rouen called after her name, have known
that her memory was regarded as that of heroine and
martyr, how astonished she would have been.</p>

<p>The thought of Joan and the various scenes in
which she played a central part, conjures up many
other historical memories also.</p>

<p>Rouen is rich in such pictures, not the pictures
painted by human hands and representing imaginary
scenes, but living pictures which, though lacking the
cinematograph, have nevertheless remained indelibly
fixed in the great drama of history. The earliest of
all is the vision of a dying man, royal in position and
by nature a king, alone, forlorn, and stripped of every
vestige of glory.</p>

<p>From the day when he had been a boy amid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
turbulence of a headless court, had heard men
whisper this and that, and look aside at himself with
significance, he had ever stood out by virtue of some
compelling power, which, even while he was still
undeveloped, drew the force from the strong and made
it a weapon on his behalf. Yet now, perhaps, those
weary eyes, fast closing, saw more plainly than ever
before. The dominions he had gained were but as
the shuffling of a pack of cards in a game, his
clemency, his loyalty of life, outweighed all the deeds
that men called great.</p>

<p>He was only sixty, but his life had begun so young
that it seemed long since that first wild dash at
Val-ès-dunes, where he had settled himself on the
ducal throne and given the outward sign of his mettle,
to the day when, soured by the loss of the wife who
had been to him the true mate, lonely, in grim dignity,
he had irritably replied to the coarse jest of the King of
France by a red-hot retort which had cost him his life.</p>

<p>Now there stands a modern church on the site of
the abbey of St Gervais, in which William then lay.
It stands a little away from the din of tempestuous
Rouen, and beneath it is the oldest crypt in France,
the crypt of St Mellon. Dimly through the dying
Conqueror’s brain scenes would flit; in them he himself
would be always the most prominent, the principal
figure; and now an <span class="locked">end&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Hark! what was that? The tones of the bell in
the Cathedral of Rouen were wafted across in at the
heavy unglazed window; it was the call for prime, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
six in the morning, and as the slow strokes fell on
his ear William recognised in them another call; he
offered up a prayer, and died.</p>

<p>Yet, by a strange mischance, those who would have
honoured the mighty dead were not present. The
pious Anselm had been summoned from Bec; but
travelling was slow, the prior was ill, and he had not
arrived. William the Conqueror’s best-beloved and
ever favourite son had hasted to seize on that
inheritance which his father had hardly dared to leave
him, except provisionally; Henry had disappeared on
a similar errand, though some say he returned in
time to accompany the body on its last journey;
between Robert and his father no love had lain, and
Robert was missing.</p>

<p>A living dog is better than a dead lion; and living
dogs there were at hand. Within an hour of his
death, the Conqueror’s body had been stripped of all
that was valuable, even the hangings of tapestry in
the chamber had been seized, and the craven souls
who had trembled at the flicker of the king’s eyelash
in life handled him contemptuously in death.</p>

<div id="ip_72" class="figcenter" style="width: 453px;"><img src="images/i_144.jpg" width="453" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">AN HOTEL COURTYARD, ROUEN</div></div>

<p>A whole day he lay there, alone and untended.
Then the news spread abroad, and bishops and
barons gathered together. The body was placed on
a bier, suitably draped, and with a great procession
was carried to Caen, as had been commanded, passing
down the Seine in its route. And to Caen we must
follow it for the last terrible scenes of that drama, for
it is with Rouen only we are now concerned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
The picture of William dying is the first of
those connected with the town which can never
be forgotten. Another of a different sort calls us
for a moment to the river-side. By 1090, Robert,
the Conqueror’s eldest son, had so misruled his
duchy that there was a prominent party in Rouen
which held it would be better to apply to William
the Red, who, though cruel enough, was a strong
and able governor. At that time Henry Beauclerc
was in league with his eldest brother, and the two
together entered Rouen, and established themselves
in the tower by the river, which was indeed the
only part of the city where they could feel safe.
This tower had been built by Duke Richard (996)
on the right bank of the Robec, near the Seine,
to replace that of Rollo, which was falling to pieces.
An affray succeeded the brothers’ entry, in which
Beauclerc led his men through Rouen, and engaged
in combat with the leading citizens. The place
was turned into a shambles, the narrow streets ran
red, and many peaceful citizens were involved.
Meantime Robert had retired to a little abbey near
the city, where he awaited the result in fear and
trembling. Henry captured the principal leader of
the town party, who was named Conan, and
brought him captive to the castle. Robert thereupon
returned, and vindictively declared that he
would not kill the traitor, but condemn him to a far
more hideous punishment&mdash;perpetual imprisonment,
which in those days of noisome, airless dungeons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
was equivalent to perpetual torture. Henry, however,
had no mind to do the thing; he thought death
was preferable from many points of view; notably,
because a dead man is forgotten, and provokes
neither sympathy nor reprisal. Therefore, with
cold brutality which equalled that of the occasional
streaks of hardness to be found in his otherwise
great father, he dragged Conan to the top of
the tower, and pitched him straight over the
ramparts. “The mangled corpse, contumeliously
dragged amidst the soaking filth from end to end
of the town, gave insulting warning to his compeers
and townsmen” (Palgrave).</p>

<p>This is the record of the Conqueror’s sons.</p>

<p>More than a hundred years later, this ancient
castle or tower was the scene of a tragedy so dark
and mysterious that it has never been wholly
penetrated, and some hold that it cannot be proved
to have taken place at Rouen at all; but our
greatest dramatist notwithstanding, the evidence
against Rouen is pretty strong, and though we
can never know the method of young Arthur’s
death, there is little doubt that here by the Seine
he was murdered. There are various suppositions
as to the manner of his death; some, with Shakespeare,
believe that he fell from the tower walls in
attempting his escape, but if this were so we may
be pretty sure that John would have made the
most of it to absolve his craven soul from the
accursed stain resting on it, which made him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
abhorred of his contemporaries. The commonly
received theory is that John took the boy out in a
boat and stabbed him with his own hand. This
does not seem impossible, for notwithstanding the
cheapness of assassins in that day, it may be
remembered that John had already been disobeyed
once when he gave orders for Arthur’s mutilation,
and he may have dreaded a like result, for even
in those days, to kill a helpless boy of fourteen
was a crime not lightly to be bought. By whatever
means it was effected, no trace remained of Arthur,
who suffered his last agonies of terror or revolt alone
and helpless, and with the added hideousness of
enduring his death at the hands of a near relative.</p>

<p>Every vestige of the old castle has now disappeared,
and on its site there stand market
buildings round three sides of a square. On the
south side is a curious double cupola&mdash;an arch over
an arch&mdash;called a chapel, the Chapelle de la Fierté,
and this is associated with a strange custom, which
must originally have had its rise in that solemn
scene when the crowd called, “Not this man, but
Barabbas!”</p>

<p>Once a year, on Ascension Day, the Chapter of
Rouen Cathedral were allowed, by the “Privilege of
St Romain,” to release a prisoner condemned to
death, and the list of such releases runs from 1210&ndash;1790.
The ceremony took place at this little
chapel; it was performed with great solemnity, and
was witnessed by a vast crowd. As it was always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
necessary in mediæval times to have some legend
to account for the origin of any custom, a legend
was forthcoming, as follows:&mdash;A mighty dragon
dwelt in the marshes by the river, and devoured
all whom he could catch. The saint Romain,
however, lured him from his place of security by
the bait of a condemned criminal, and then made
the sign of the cross over him, after which he
had no difficulty in leading the beast captive to
the town, at the end of his stole. Therefore, in
memory of this great deliverance, a condemned
criminal was freed each year.</p>

<p>Among historical scenes it is impossible to forget
the terrible siege of 1417, when stern-faced Harry
of England sat down before the walls and waited.
His fleet was to the north, his army had crossed
to the south, so that Rouen was cut off from
assistance from Paris and left to her fate. The
citizens made desperate sorties now and again;
they could make no impression on the mighty
force opposed to them. It was the end of July
when Henry appeared, and by the time winter
came, the horrors of starvation were at their
height. A scene which has been enacted in other
sieges, and more than once depicted with ghastly
power upon canvas, now took place. Fifteen
thousand “outsiders,” countrymen who did not
belong to Rouen, but had taken refuge inside her
walls, were turned out, and on the bitter icy slopes,
between the full-armoured English and the rigid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
walls, they writhed in agony, tearing up the very
earth to still their craving, and dying raving mad,
or of utter weakness. It is said that 50,000
persons died before New Year’s Day, when envoys
were sent to ask terms of the English. But it was
not for another ten days that terms were agreed
upon as follows: Life to all but nine persons
whom Henry chose, was granted, and an enormous
price was fixed as ransom. Then Henry received
the keys, and until 1449 the town remained
English. The Duke of Bedford ruled here as
regent during the infancy of King Henry VI., and
he was succeeded by the Duke of Somerset, under
whom the final surrender took place. He was
supported by the veteran Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury,
who had seen a hundred fights; but well
they knew that the case was hopeless. Fortress
after fortress had fallen before King Charles of
France, and in the town itself was a strong party
in favour of France. At length Somerset made
a disgraceful compact with the French before his
gate, by which he surrendered the town, and delivered
Talbot and other officers up as prisoners. He
also pledged the English to surrender Honfleur,
Caudebec, and Arques, and to pay 50,000 crowns.
Charles VII. entered on the 10th of November 1449.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to give the slightest sketch
of Rouen without mentioning the names of the
great among her sons. Greatest of all is Corneille
the poet, born in 1606, in a house standing on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
site of No. 4 in the present Rue Pierre Corneille;
Maupassant and Hector Malot owed part of their
education to Rouen; Flaubert was born at Rouen
in 1821; and the roll of lesser names contains
many which, if not known across the Channel, are
representative of good work to their own countrymen.</p>

<p>Such is Rouen, a city with as many facets as
a jewel, each one of which contributes something
to the perfect whole. We can see her as a city of
magnificent churches, a city of famous Renaissance
buildings, a city of narrow, crooked, winding streets,
cobble-paved, and lined by mediæval timbered
houses; we can see her in the light of an historic
past, or as a wideawake city of the present day,
with trams running along broad thoroughfares,
with spacious quays and busy trade; she is a
medley of the past and the present, and the one
or the other is seen as it is sought. But there is one
thing to be noted, she is not a city of the Normans,
those Norman dukes who held her as their capital
seem to have been utterly effaced; there are but
few fragments surviving from their time, and those
either difficult to find, or so much incorporated
and overlaid with later work, that for all superficial
purposes they are obliterated: in Rouen the magnificence
of mediæval times has made an ineffaceable
impression; she is a mediæval city if you will, or a
modern city, or both together; but above all things
she is thoroughly French, and not Norman.</p>

<span class="subhead">CAEN</span></h2>

<p>The admirers of Caen rank it high. Mr Freeman
says: “Caen is a town well-nigh without a rival.
It shares with Oxford the peculiarity of having no
one predominant object. At Amiens, at Peterborough&mdash;we
may add at Cambridge&mdash;one single
gigantic building lords it over everything; Caen
and Oxford throw up a forest of towers and spires
without any one building being conspicuously
predominant. It is a town which never was a
Bishop’s See, but which contains four or five
churches each fit to have been a cathedral.”</p>

<p>It is quite true that in the richness of its churches
Caen rivals Rouen. And if we except the splendid
abbey of William and Matilda which flank each end
of the town, most of these churches belong to the
fifteenth century, and show the marvellous combination
of grace and strength, of richness without
tawdriness, in which the workmen of that date were
unrivalled. After its churches, the most notable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
feature in Caen is its collection of Renaissance
dwelling-houses, called hotels, which are to be found
here and there&mdash;but not always conspicuously&mdash;in
its streets. Beyond the churches and hotels, Caen
is not otherwise a mediæval town; though many of
the streets are narrow and old-fashioned, they do not
contain anything like the same number of carved and
timber-framed houses as are to be found at Rouen.
There are a few of these to be seen, lying for the
most part in the narrow streets at the west end of
St Pierre. The Maison des Quatrains in the Rue de
Geoles is one which visitors most frequently find; it is
a large timber house in excellent preservation, but of
plain design; on the tower in the court is the date
1541, though the house itself is older than this. A
far more fascinating example is to be seen in the little
steep street going up to the castle. This house is
small, and no line is in its right plane; it looks as if it
would very soon fall down altogether, yet it is carved
everywhere, with human figures and faces, all
animated by that diablerie and wicked mirth which
the carvers of the Middle Ages seem to have been
able to pour forth from their tools at will.</p>

<p>Beautiful bits and picturesque corners are to be
found in Caen in plenty, as in every continental town
with a long history, but they are different in kind
from those we see in Rouen. The most beautiful
part of all the town is to be found around that famous
church, St Pierre.</p>

<p>Shady horse-chestnuts in all the glory of delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
foliage and fresh pink flower, show up in contrast with
the towering fretwork pinnacles of the church. Close
by, a tram crowded with people going home from work
stops for a moment, to fill up every foot of space on
its two cars before it winds slowly away, toot-tooting
to clear the lines.</p>

<p>The pavement near at hand is covered with flowerpots
in bloom, azaleas, roses, cinerarias, pelargonium,
and fuchsia, showing flashing lights like those of some
rich window of stained glass, and the foot traffic
flows round about the impediment tranquilly; for in
all foreign towns every shopkeeper seems to have a
prescriptive right to the bit of pavement before his
door.</p>

<p>In front of the church is a space of green grass,
with seats and a cool basin of water. The evening
sun, which has now left in shadow all the base of the
masonry, picks out the lines and curves and angles
of the parapet and the buttresses above, those
wonderful flying buttresses with bossy pinnacles; it
shows up the stiff, eternally yearning gargoyles, and
the red-tiled roof. High above, up against the
brilliant clearness of a pale-blue sky, swallows skim
and wheel around one of the most graceful and
perfect spires ever man devised or wrought.</p>

<p>Opposite to the church, in the depth of grey
evening shadow, is the great Hotel de Valois or
Escoville, a Renaissance palace, built early in the
sixteenth century. The lower part is occupied by a
row of shops; above rise small engaged pillars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
between which are the lofty windows, now cut into
two stages. In the courtyard all is gloom and dirt;
a huge scaffolding covers most of the building, and
grimly down from those once princely walls look the
gigantic statues of David and Judith, each carrying
the gory burden of a head!</p>

<p>Above, but difficult to see without a crick in the
neck, is a lantern tower in two stages, recalling a little
the famous domes of Chambord. There was formerly
the figure of a white horse carved on the stone above
the principal door, and the symbol exercised greatly
the imaginations of antiquarians, some of whom went
so far as to see in it the Pale Horse of Revelation. In
some lines written on the hotel by M. de Brieux, we
<span class="locked">read:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in0">The house was built in 1585 by Nicholas de Valois,
Sieur d’Escoville, the richest man in the town, who
died even as he entered into possession; for, the
first time he seated himself at table in his new
dwelling he was choked by an oyster, at the early
age of forty-seven. This hotel, with many other
buildings in Caen, is attributed to Hector Sohier,
the architect of part of St Pierre, and it is supposed
that he carried on the two great buildings that
faced one another&mdash;the church and hotel&mdash;partly at
the same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
In most Norman towns the first object for which
the visitor seeks is the cathedral, and the second the
castle. Caen has no cathedral; and though it has
a castle, no one can see it, for it is used as a barracks,
and entrance is forbidden. In any case the castle is
not at all evident; it stands on no great elevation,
and has to be sought for by a narrow back street.
Yet it has seen many a spirited historical feat, and
been through not a few sieges. From time immemorial
a fort of some kind has stood upon the
site, but it was William&mdash;the great William&mdash;who
founded the present building. On his death the
castle formed one of Robert’s most important strongholds,
and it was from thence he started out on his
crusading expedition. On his return he made Caen
his headquarters, and added greatly to the fortifications
in prospect of being attacked by his brother
Henry. Yet when Robert was overthrown at
Tinchebray, these very defences fell into Henry’s
hands, and served him against whom they had been
intended. That the town was of great importance
then, was shown by the fact that when Henry
established two permanent exchequers, one for
England and one for Normandy, it was at Caen
and not at Rouen the latter was placed. Caen
was one of Henry’s favourite residences; here was
born his eldest son Robert, afterwards Earl of
Gloucester, whose mother was Nesta, the Welsh
girl who managed to hold the king’s affections so
long. In days when loyalty was a rare virtue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Robert proved himself throughout his life a loyal
brother, and the Empress Maud owed much to his
strong arm and good faith. John took refuge at
Caen after the murder of his nephew, but he soon
had to retreat, and the city opened its gates to
Philip Augustus in 1204. However it was not
destined to remain consistently French, for it was
besieged by Edward III. in 1346, when, according
to Froissart, the town “était grosse et forte, pleine
de très-grande draperies et de toutes marchandises
et de riches bourgeois et de noble dames et de belles
églises.” After a stern resistance this rich prize fell
into the hands of the English, who pillaged it for
three days, and reaped a magnificent harvest of
“draperies” and other goods, so that many stout
ships were sent laden across to England. It however
reverted again to the French, and was subject
to another siege under Henry V., when, with the
rest of Normandy, it remained attached to the
English crown from 1417 to 1450. It was at this
time Henry founded the famous university, which
continued to flourish throughout the change in the
town’s ownership. After 1450 the castle was twice
besieged by the French themselves, during the
Protestant wars.</p>

<div id="ip_84" class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><img src="images/i_160.jpg" width="450" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">THE MILK CARRIER</div></div>

<p>So much for a rough sketch of its history. But
Caen belonged far more than this to the personal
history of William the Conqueror, who had particular
reasons for loving it. When he and Matilda,
his wife, had agreed to rear two abbeys in penance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
for the sin of having married though they were
first cousins, it was at Caen that they established
their twin abbeys, one at the north and the other at
the south end of the town.</p>

<p>William’s abbey indeed was begun in 1066, the
year in which he had established himself as supreme
in a wider sphere than Normandy, and he doubtless
returned to the scene of the work with none the less
interest because of his larger experience. There is a
little vagueness about the date when the sister abbey
was actually begun; some say in 1062, which would
make it slightly in advance of St Etienne, and it
seems to have been consecrated in 1066, while St
Etienne was not consecrated until 1077, when the
ceremony was performed by Lanfranc, who had been
brought from Bec to be the first abbot, but had been
rapidly advanced to the Archbishopric of Canterbury,
which at the time of the consecration he had held
for seven years.</p>

<p>The opening ceremony was an occasion of great
solemnity, and the king with his queen and eldest
son Robert, then in early manhood, were all present.
The church was not at first exactly as we see it now,
for the two mighty western towers, grandly simple,
had no spires, which were added in the fourteenth
century. In William’s time also the church was
shorter, ending in an apse. The present choir dates
from a couple of centuries after that fine opening
scene, and is of the Pointed, not the Roman, or as
we call it, the Norman, style like the nave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Could William, when seated on his throne, with
his wife and son by his side, overlooking that vast
crowd of nobles, knights, and commoners, to whom
his lightest word was law, have gazed ahead into
the grim mystery of the future, he would have seen
a far other picture. A lonely death, with his son
a traitor, and himself deserted, at last to be hastily
and ignominiously buried by the charity of the
monks, whose munificent patron he had been.
Could he have seen such a vision, the realities of
power and place might have seemed less pleasantly
substantial to him!</p>

<p>None of the Conqueror’s sons are buried in the
abbey, though the bones of the youngest, Henry,
rested for nearly a month before the high altar,
waiting for a favourable wind by which they could
be taken over to England for burial.</p>

<p>Close by the abbey William built a palace, where
now stands the École Normande; nothing of the
palace remains, though a later building which
succeeded it has been partly adapted for the
school.</p>

<p>The earlier kings of the Norman race seem to
have resided at palace or castle indifferently while
at Caen. The abbey grew and flourished. It was
at the height of its power in the twelfth century,
but was totally ruined in the religious wars at the
end of the sixteenth.</p>

<p>The large building, called the Lycée, to the east
of the church, dates from 1726, and a Gothic hall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
used as a gymnasium, dating from the fourteenth
century, is considered to have been once part of the
abbey.</p>

<p>Matilda’s Abbaye aux Dames, or St Trinité, has
one great advantage over St Etienne&mdash;it can be
seen to advantage from the broad open space which
lies before it. The church, like the other, has two
western towers, but they are more decorative, not
so grand and stern as those of St Etienne, and
show a charming and original feature in the
row of oval openings beneath the parapet. The
windows are long, narrow, and round-headed.
Matilda’s church, as well as William’s, is one of
the purest remaining examples of Norman work.
The husband and wife were parted in death: he lies
at St Etienne, and she here. Their love was genuine
in an age when wedded love was a rarity, more
especially with kings; but they were bitterly
estranged in their quarrels over their sons before
the end came. Matilda died four years before
her husband, and her grave may be looked on
with reverence as that of the ancestress of all
succeeding sovereigns who have held the English
crown.</p>

<p>The city hospital buildings, dating from 1726,
occupy the site of the convent which Matilda
founded for gentlewomen of the highest rank, and
of which her own eldest daughter, Cecily, was the first
abbess. It is said that she was dedicated to this
office at the time of the consecration of the church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
in 1066, when she can only have been about twelve
or thirteen years of age.</p>

<p>After the two great abbeys, and perhaps before
them, in the minds of many, comes that jewel of
the fifteenth century, St Pierre, of which the exterior
has already been slightly described. The chief
feature is the towering spire, so pierced as to give a
fairy-like appearance of elegance, and yet so firm
in its lines as to produce a powerful impression of
strength. This spire was built in the beginning of
the fourteenth century, on the foundation of an
earlier one. The nave followed, and the choir was
completed about 1521. But in spite of the two
centuries over which the building spread, the whole
design is emphatically of one style and time, of
which it forms one of the most brilliant examples.
In the two disused churches in Caen, St Etienne
the Less and St Gillies, we may see the same design
and style in the pierced parapet, the flying buttresses,
and the decorated pinnacles; though parts of these
churches are of the twelfth century. This is not
so notable in St Gillies, but in St Etienne the
Less, in spite of the growth of weeds in all the
crevices, in spite of discolourment, and filled-in
windows, in spite of bars and general decay and
disuse, we have a most beautiful church, and one
that almost any English town would consider its
most precious possession.</p>

<p>There are many other churches which might be
mentioned, but we have space only for one, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
of its peculiarity. St Sauveur consists of two
churches, which were originally built side by side,
and now, with the partition wall removed, form
one! Not far from St Etienne is St Nicholas,
belonging to the eleventh and twelfth centuries; and
in the Rue St Jean&mdash;down which the station traffic
passes&mdash;is the church of St Jean, dating from the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.</p>

<p>After the churches in interest come the Renaissance
hotels, of which we have already described
the principal one; of the others, there are two
connected with the name of Etienne Duval de
Mondrainville which cannot be overlooked. These
are to be found in the little narrow street running
behind St Sauveur. Etienne de Mondrainville was
born in 1507, and was for a long time one of the
most important personages in Caen. He twice
made a fortune, and was twice ruined by the
jealousy of his comrades. He was an energetic
man, and pushed his trade to an extent which at
that time was remarkable; he carried on trade with
Africa and America, and his staple was corn from
Barbary.</p>

<p>The smaller of the two houses he built stands
in a little courtyard. The carving, the miniature
tower, and the dormer windows are all charming,
and are enhanced by the bit of green in front. In
1550 the Chambre de la Monnaie was moved here
from St Lo, and the house retained the name.
Across the street is the larger house of about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
same date, now a printing establishment. It was
built in 1549, and the cupola and lantern, columns
and dormers, all bespeak its date. Etienne died in
1578, leaving two sons, one an abbé and the other
a soldier. The Hotel de Than, in the Rue St Jean,
is another house of the same date, telling of the
wealth and opulence of the burghers of Caen after
the city had recovered from the effects and
uncertainty of the English occupation, and become
once more French.</p>

<p>From all that has been said, it may be gathered
that there is much to see in Caen, and yet the account
is fragmentary, and has not told the half. There are
other churches not mentioned, other hotels to be found
in dark courtyards and down unpromising tunnels;
there is the famous Maison des Gens d’Armes, built
in the reign of François First, only a mile or so out
on the Ouistreham Road, and there are countless
other features that would take long to discover, but
are well worth the explorers trouble. By the river
Orne there are wide quais and boulevards, and the
great race-course fringed with trees. In the centre
of the town is the pleasant and well-kept Place de la
Republique, once the Place Royale, a name still
retained by the principal hotel, which stands at one
end. Here there are the usual flower-beds, and seats,
and trees, and on the west side rise the large and fine
public buildings, the Hotel de Ville, including the
splendid public library, the inevitable Musée, and
behind is the Prefecture. From all of which it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
be gathered that Caen is a town which in no way
neglects the interests of her citizens. Yet with all
these manifold attractions, with her many advantages
and her historic past, it is impossible to deny that a
slight feeling of dulness broods over Caen. It is
indescribable, it is unanalysable, but perhaps it may
be due to what I have before called the spirit of a
town; perhaps Caen as an entity lacks originality,
or else why is it that English visitors who go there,
full of intelligent appreciation, who see much, and
who acknowledge the intrinsic interest of what they
have seen, leave at the end of two days, feeling glad
to go?</p>

<p>Malherbe the poet was born at Caen in 1555,
and it is impossible to quit the city without mentioning
the name of Charlotte Corday, who, though not a
native, passed her girlhood here with an aunt. The
house in which she lived has disappeared, but No. 148
Rue St Jean stands on the site of it. She came here
after being educated in a convent, and seems to have
been left much to herself, spending her time in reading
such works as those of Voltaire.</p>

<p>After the downfall of the party of the Girondins
in 1793, some of the leaders came to Caen, and
Charlotte attended their meetings. It was at this
time she conceived her courageous idea of going to
Paris to assassinate Marat, who typified all that was
worst in tyranny. She obtained a passport in which
she is described as being twenty-four years of age,
only 5 feet 1 inch in height, with chestnut hair and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
grey eyes. Her face was oval, her forehead high,
her nose long, and her chin dimpled. The quiet
determination with which she executed her project,
and the absence of all revulsion after it, put her on
the same level as the other great heroine, Joan of
Arc. A country which has produced two such
women, may well take high rank.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="subhead">FALAISE</span></h2>

<p>Although Falaise is not a typical Norman town&mdash;for
it has too much character of its own for that&mdash;there
are certain features here which are to be found
in nearly all the other towns in Normandy, such as
the long narrow streets, roughly paved with cobbles,
and the irregular houses, most of which are neither
very old nor very new, but just softened by time.</p>

<p>To linger in the streets is to get many a peep
which, transferred to canvas, would give lasting
pleasure. In one place we see long narrow passages
running between houses; the black shadow is in
contrast with the yellow sunlight on the pavement
beyond, and at one end there falls over a parapet
a mass of glorious deep-tinged lilac. Surely lilac
never grows elsewhere as it grows in Falaise! In
another place there is a tiny court, with an indescribable
medley of steps, grey stone, worn beams, gable
ends, and child life. We come suddenly upon a tiny
chapel with a bit of ancient moulding that proclaims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
its hoary age; it is perched upon a rock, up the steep
sides of which straggle staring yellow wallflowers,
brilliant blue forget-me-not, and stiff tulips of various
colours.</p>

<p>One of the most striking bits of Falaise is the
quiet square before the Hotel de Ville, where grass
grows between the cobbles, overshadowed by the
mighty figure of William on horseback, many times
life-size. Round the pedestal are graven his
ancestors, the previous dukes, men to be reckoned
with, one and all, but not one to compare with their
great successor, whose magnificent energy and power
the artist has succeeded in transfixing in metal.</p>

<div id="ip_94" class="figcenter" style="width: 451px;"><img src="images/i_174.jpg" width="451" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">A STREET VENDOR, FALAISE</div></div>

<p>On one side, aslant to the square, is the church of
La Trinité, a curious church, built without any rules;
and at its east end bestriding a street, with a delightful
disregard for the change of level. It has a fine
porch, and admirably carved buttresses, and over a
great part of it runs that profusion of carving which
the ancient craftsman seems to have thrown in for
sheer love of it. The tower, however, is a note of
ugliness, interrupting much pleasant quaintness. This
is not the most notable church in Falaise; that
honour is claimed by St Gervais in the widened space
in the middle of the main street, and St Gervais is all
glorious without but disappointing within, where its
dull lines are devitalised by the terrible mockery
perpetrated in the name of decoration. Outside,
however, the warmly tinted sandstone, carved in
every fantastic semblance, rises grandly against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
clear blue sky. Particularly noticeable are the
gargoyles, turning this way and that, and the
wonderful moulding round the tower windows. The
restoration has affected notable improvement on the
exterior, clearing away all the old houses which clung
like barnacles to the walls.</p>

<p>If one could only reverse the wheel of time and see
the church as it looked at its great dedication festival,
when, glittering in the smartness of work fresh from
the chisel, it was dedicated in the presence of Henry
the First of England! Would the workmen differ
greatly in type, we wonder, from the group who now
sit lazily sunning themselves on the steps? The present
men, who are in blue blouses, are spare, not large
of limb, with faces the colour of their own house-tiles,
with sharp thin features and keen eyes? The clothing
of the poor in Falaise is not so picturesque as in
many parts of Normandy&mdash;the blouse is here as
everywhere, but there is nothing else striking in the
costume of the men, and only the older women wear
caps, and those of a very simple sort; the young ones
go about with heads uncovered, and hair neatly coiled
up in a little top-knot, after the usual manner of the
French.</p>

<p>One of the most attractive views in Falaise, is
that to be gained by standing on the raised road
that leaves the town direct to Caen, and looking
east and west. In the deep fosse, where once a
mighty river must have run, there is now only a
dirty ditch, which serves the women of Falaise for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
a washing-place, as it did nine hundred years ago.
On either side rise neat trimly-kept gardens, terrace
upon terrace, rich in greenery. In fact, the masses
of green foliage which break up any general view of
Falaise are among its principal charms. The influence
of environment is seen in character, for even the
smallest and poorest cottages have their window-boxes
and flowerpots, and the neatness of the
gardens is a sight to marvel at; even the wee
children love flowers. In the shops, especially the
butchers’, where least of all one would expect to
see them, one finds great bowls and pyramids of
flowers, so large that they could hardly be encircled
by both arms; these are made up of lilac, rhododendron,
pale pink peonies, tulips, and forget-me-not,
and are such Gargantuan bouquets as would make
sunshine in any London house.</p>

<div id="ip_96" class="figcenter" style="width: 448px;"><img src="images/i_180.jpg" width="448" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">A LITTLE NORMAN GIRL</div></div>

<p>A rough and narrow track leads along the
northern side of the river opposite the castle. This
is a very poor part of the town, where one small
room serves for bedroom and living-room for a
whole family, and the dark nut-brown interiors are
in striking contrast with the blaze of sunlight outside.
The children are mostly healthy, sometimes strikingly
so; and among them it is difficult to pick out any
special type; bright brown eyes and sepia locks
are seen side by side with hair perfectly flaxen in
colour and eyes of palest watery blue; both types
alike greet the “English” as a friend, for too many
English are seen here to allow them to be awesome,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
and perhaps also the little ones learn with their
earliest history there is a bond of kinship between
them and these strange people who come from across
the sea. From nearly every house comes the quiet
hum of a hand-machine, wherewith men and women
knit socks and other garments; this sound mingles
with the splash and thud of the women busily
washing clothes in the little narrow ditch, kneeling
in their wooden tubs, arms in ice-cold water, and
backs bent in the occupation which seems to take
up far the largest proportion of a French peasant-woman’s
day.</p>

<p>There are little bridges over the water, and footpaths
winding in and out, and above all is the clear
vivid sky of a May day. If we went on a little
further until we were almost beneath the perpendicular
walls of the castle, we should come all at once on
two things, which would carry us back into the far
past, for a large tannery still spreads irregular buildings
on the very place where once rose the tannery
of William’s maternal grandfather. Its presence is
quickly felt, and we can see the peasants coming
away from it laden with the little “cakes” of waste
bark called “mottes,” which are used for fuel, and
so oddly resemble peats. Not far off a sound of
voices and splashing of water will bring us to a
strange place, the town washing-shed, where, with
the dim light from the roof gleaming on the soapy
green water, and the time-worn posts, we shall find
a score of women, perhaps some of them actual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
collateral descendants of Arlotta’s, slapping and
splashing the soiled linen with as much heartiness
as ever did the girl who was to become the mother
of a line of kings. It is the same spot, the same
stream, whose name is Ante, only the place is now roofed
over instead of being open to the sky, as it was in
Arlotta’s day. We leave the valley and wind upward
past some tumbledown cottages of picturesque lath
and plaster; past others with such a solid foundation
of stone showing in the low doorways, that they
seem as if they might well have stood since the
Conqueror’s day. On and on until we reach a lane,
with high hedges and lush rich green grass, and
pass out at last on to a flat tableland, where the
purple-red orchis stand up like little tin soldiers in
the grass, and heather and gorse grow everywhere.
We are upon Mont Mirat, and at one end is a
clump of grey rocks close by a group of windswept
firs; quite suddenly, at our feet as it were, a familiar
object greets us, startlingly close; it is the flat cap
of the Talbot tower, and as we near it, we see the
whole castle appear, and realise we are on the other
side of the ravine, on a level with the tower, which
is in reality some distance away, but which, in the
brilliant clearness of the atmosphere, looks as if a
well-thrown stone might easily strike it. The jackdaws
wheel and scream around the walls, and their
shadows flit after them, growing, fading, disappearing
with infinite fantasy. And the castle is a vision
of light, bathed in the rays of a westering sun; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
appears as a perfect mass of yellow, from the deep
dead gold of the streaks of lichen to the palest
biscuit colour of the patches on the walls, fading to
dun and sepia in the shadows.</p>

<p>You can still see in the castle the room in
which the mighty William is said to have been
born, though all probability points to his birthplace
having been in the valley below. The room shown
is in no sense a royal apartment; it is a little, dark,
dungeon-like chamber, airless and lightless, built in
the thickness of the wall; but sleeping accommodation
was not made much account of then. In any case,
the castle and the valley on which we look were
the earliest associations of William’s childhood.
Here he lay an unconscious babe, when, as we are
told by Wace, he was visited by two of the premier
barons in the land, one of whom exclaimed prophetically,
“Par toi e par ta ligne sert la mienne
moult abaisse.”</p>

<p>Here in that varied childhood, passed partly in
the unsavoury tanyard with his grandfather, partly
in the castle with the stern-faced man who caressed
him, and whom he was told to call father; eyed
askance by the richly-dressed young nobles; hugged
by the simple-minded Arlotta, he grew up. Gradually
a knowledge of his own peculiar position, of
his royal but sullied birth, of the battle before
him, must have forced themselves into the mind of a
boy far more thoughtful than his years; and by
the time he was eight, at an age when most boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
have hardly begun to think, he had to take up his
stern inheritance.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that spring is the time to
see Falaise&mdash;spring, when the trees are at their
freshest and richest, undimmed by dust or heat.
By standing on the highest part of one line of
rocks, we can see behind the castle in miniature
the church of Guibray perched on a hill, its conical
spire showing up against a distant line of horizon,
so straight, so blue, so misty, it might well be the
sea.</p>

<p>The town itself shows as a mass of roofs, varying
from brick red to slate blue, but mostly the colour of
rust; these are strangely high-pitched to an English
eye, and show well amid the mass of complementary
green, in which there are darker touches in the
copper beeches and cedars here and there&mdash;a
magnificent panorama, with enough sentiment and
history about it to keep it from the insipidity of
mere beauty, and nothing more.</p>

<p>Only second in interest to the story of William’s
precarious boyhood, is the tale of that other boy,
Arthur, the young Duke of Brittany, who, at the
age of fourteen, was brought to Falaise a prisoner
in the hands of his treacherous, crafty, and
unscrupulous uncle, John. The room in which
Arthur was confined is still pointed out near
the supposed birthplace of William. It was in
August that he came here, and often must he have
looked out over the wide horizon, wondering if his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
faithful Bretons would come to his rescue. All
through the winter he remained a close prisoner;
but he won the sympathy of his gaoler, Hubert,
and when John, finding him obdurate in his refusal
to sign away his rights, gave the cruel order that
he should be so maimed as to render him incapable
of ruling, Hubert tacitly refused to obey
it, pretending to the king that the boy had
died, and even arranging a mock funeral. It
seems odd, that having got so far he could not
manage to compass Arthur’s escape altogether;
but when matters had reached this point “the
fury of the Bretons became boundless, and Hubert
soon found it necessary, for John’s own sake, to
confess his fraud” (Miss Norgate). This incident
showed John that if he were to rule in peace he
must use sterner methods, and Arthur was, at
the end of January, removed to Rouen, from which
time we hear no more of him.</p>

<p>A good deal of the castle which still stands is of
the thirteenth century, and there is no reason to
doubt that it was within these very walls the proud
boy ate out his heart in loneliness and captivity.</p>

<p>A word must be given to the famous General
Talbot, first Earl of Shrewsbury, whose name is
kept alive in the great donjon which he built. He
held the castle as governor during the English
occupation under Henry V. and VI., and his deeds
are scattered broadcast in the annals of the continual
fighting of the period. We hear of him at Dieppe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
in Anjou, and in Maine, and his name became a
synonym for dash and daring. At the age of more
than seventy years he was slain in actual warfare
at Castillon!</p>

<p>There is one other association of a generation
preceding that of John which cannot be wholly
omitted. It was at the Castle of Falaise that
William the Lion, King of Scotland, did homage
to King Henry of England, acknowledging him as
overlord, and thereby regaining a limited freedom.</p>

<p>The castle can be visited at any time, and though
there is not much to see&mdash;the keep being a mere
shell, and the chapel not now shown&mdash;it is worth
going over for the sake of the superb views which its
situation commands. It is said that Rollo built a
fort on this site; and certainly if he ever saw it he
must have done so, for a more perfect position for a
fort can scarcely be imagined. It was in this
building or its immediate predecessor that Robert
was besieged by the brother he afterwards so traitorously
murdered. It is probable that Robert himself
built up and restored the castle after his accession
to power. A good deal of what stands, however,
dates from much later, including Earl Talbot’s
tower.</p>

<div id="ip_102" class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;"><img src="images/i_190.jpg" width="454" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">RURAL SCENE</div></div>

<p>Beside the memorable siege under Henry V. of
England, Falaise has been retaken more than once,
notably by Charles VII., commanding in person in
1450; and by the French king, Henri IV., in
1590.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
In the neighbourhood of Falaise there is some
of the most attractive scenery in Normandy. It is
true that the main roads, which stretch out from
the town like the rays of a starfish, are not interesting.
They are of the typical green-bordered,
poplar-lined kind. But the side roads are very
different. Take, for instance, the direct route
between Falaise and that other castle-fortress,
Domfront. Here there are woods of straight-stemmed
beeches and proud oaks covering acres
of rounded hills that fold softly, contour on contour,
revealing at last a distance seemingly infinite in
its horizon. Wide, splendidly engineered roads
sweep in flattened curves down the hillsides to the
brown river, amid its brilliant grass, and rise again
as smoothly. Every vista shows some picture;
perhaps a tiny church perched on the top of a hill,
its spire rising sharply, or a tall, stern Calvary
set against a background of firs. The number of
these Calvaries bearing recent dates, would seem to
show that faith still shines brightly among the
country people, whatever may be the trend of
thought in the large towns.</p>

<p>The road passes many a typical Norman village
of the poorer sort&mdash;villages where the houses are
made of lath and plaster or lath and mud, and are
set about anyhow and anywhere, rather as if they
had come together from some neighbourly instinct
than had been regularly built as a village. They
stand often in a little plot of ground, worn and poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
enough, but made shady by the apple and pear
trees. The umber of the simple cottage walls, and
the peculiar dead colour of grass in shade, make a
particular effect. Under the trees the mother of
the household sits sewing, as often as not with a
child beside her.</p>

<div id="ip_104" class="figcenter" style="width: 510px;"><img src="images/i_196.jpg" width="510" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">STARTING FOR THE WASHING-SHED</div></div>

<p>The women do a great deal of the work. Far
out on a country road one overtakes an old, wrinkled,
shrivelled woman, whose right place is surely not far
from her hearthstone, trudging along with a great
scythe over her shoulder. The market carts one
meets on the roads are driven by women more
often than men; women tend the cows as they
feed quietly by the wayside; women do the work
in the fields; they do the milking, frequently also in
the fields; where the great glittering copper jugs may
be seen, standing on the grass, shining in the sun;
the women make the butter; and when one thinks
that to all this are added the multifarious duties of
maternity and housekeeping, there is little wonder
that Norman women have small time to think of
their personal appearance, and are usually far from
beautiful, though their brown shining faces generally
have that comeliness which the content of a
well-filled useful life gives. On the roads all over
Normandy one meets with donkey carts, for donkeys
are more largely used than with us, and they form
a contrast to the fine team of great horses over
which the carter cracks his whip, and whose height
is greatly increased to the eye by the monstrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
sheepskins, dyed dark blue, with which their collars
are nearly always adorned. In some parts the
collars themselves are resplendent, painted red and
yellow, and bells jingle at every step, making a
team of horses as striking an object as a show.
Yoked oxen of massive build are still occasionally
seen, notably in the country about Gisors.</p>

<p>The situation of the castle at Domfront is
curiously like that of the castle at Falaise; both
stand on a spur of cliff, separated from a similar
spur by a deep ravine in which runs a tiny stream.
But at Domfront the scene is more striking, for the
rocks are higher, the ravine is narrower, and the
great masses of strata, inclined at an angle of 45°,
would fit into one another if pushed together like two
pieces of a child’s puzzle. It seems almost incredible
that water can have exercised such immense corrosive
force, the appearance is rather as if a giant hand had
chiselled out the rocks, for their masses would require
no less than a Titanic agency, yet we know that
from time immemorial that little stream the Varennes
has run in this cleft.</p>

<p>The peculiarities of the situation are best seen
from the fir-crowned, heather-covered heights
opposite; and it is the situation that makes Domfront,
for the castle is a mere ruin, picturesque
enough, and giving an excuse for the public garden
that runs around its base, but not in itself interesting.
The site is grander far than that of the famous
Chateau-Gaillard, grander even than that of Falaise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
for the sheer height is stupendous; no wonder
Domfront was a strong castle and house of defence
to him who held it.</p>

<p>The view from the plateau is limited only by vision.
A single hill to the south-west stands out above
the plain. In the immediate foreground, just below,
are a few toy houses, and a tiny, neat church,
cruciform, and bearing Norman date in every
line of its architecture. It was only ten or eleven
years junior to the chateau in its first building, and
has long outlived it. The man who built both
chateau and church, Guillaume de Belesme, sleeps
within the latter. He had not held the chateau
so much as forty years, when a stronger William
than he, the mighty Conqueror, swooped down
upon him and drove him out. Of another Belesme,
a scion of the same house, we shall hear elsewhere.</p>

<p>William’s successors retained the castle in their
own hands, and Henry II. here received the nuncio
sent by the Pope to reconcile him and Becket. In the
religious wars of the sixteenth century the castle was
seized and held by the Protestants, and only taken
after a bitter siege; otherwise it has not much
recorded history. It is peaceful enough at present,
surrounded by a charming garden, where one may
wander at will, gazing out over the widespread
view, watching the swallows wheel and skim far
below, and hearing the song of countless birds,
which, here as elsewhere in Normandy, build preferably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
in the neighbourhood of man to escape their
more dreaded foe, the magpie.</p>

<p>There is an old rhyme which <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“Domfront, ville de malheur<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arrivé a midi pendu à une heure.”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Though the reason why the town should have
earned so unhappy a reputation is lost in the mists
of antiquity.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of Domfront is full of interest:
westward lies Mortain, which has a bit of ruined
castle, speaking of the building destroyed by Henry I.
after Tinchebray. Mortain is interesting because
of its counts. The first of any general interest is
that Robert, half-brother of the Conqueror, son of
Arlotta and Herlouin, who took great part in his
brother’s conquests, and accompanied him to
England, being the first Norman to receive a grant
of land after Hastings. He was made Earl of
Cornwall, and received also large estates in Devon,
Somerset, and Yorkshire. The title had previously
been held by the Comte de St Sauveur, and it was
after his rebellion it was joined to that of Mortain,
and the two went down the ages together. John
Sans Terre, when only a little boy of eight, became
Count of Mortain and Vicomte du Côtentin. Though
the first Count Robert is known chiefly as a rather
rough soldier, he was a large benefactor to the Church,
founding the abbey of which, as usual, the church
remains, and but little else. The parish church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
of Mortain is due to a later gift of the same
patron.</p>

<p>Mortain abounds in beautiful peeps; its irregular
rocks stand up in fantastic shapes amid numbers of
trees, and the broken ground makes great variety
of scenery. It is chiefly celebrated, however, for its
waterfall, notable only in a country where such a
possession is literally unique. The Great Cascade,
as it is called, is about sixty-five feet high, and should
be seen in wet weather if possible, or the glory of
Normandy’s only waterfall will be sadly discounted.
Northward is Vire, with a ruined castle, which was
rebuilt in the twelfth century, and demolished by
Richelieu’s order in 1630. But the fine gateway
with its tower belfry is what everyone goes to see
at Vire.</p>

<p>Not far from Vire is Tinchebray, the site of the
brothers’ struggle. This battle is mainly of
importance because it indicated a curious reversal
of that at Hastings. Then a Norman duke had
conquered England, at Tinchebray an English king
conquered Normandy. Freeman says “the fight of
Tinchebray really was a battle, one of the very few
pitched battles of the age,” and he decides that it
must have been on the flat ground near the station
that the historic contest was fought, when Robert fell
into the hands of a brother some eight or ten years
his junior.</p>

<p>If instead of coming north-westward from Domfront
we had gone north-eastward, we should have come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
a district not so beautiful in natural scenery as that
about Mortain, but in itself well worth study.
Argentan has the donjon of an ancient castle, a
fifteenth-century church, and several other points well
worth attention. The two small places of Exmes and
Almenèches are associated with the name Robert of
Belesmes, who seems to have been a monster of
cruelty. He is said to have plucked out the eyes of a
little godson; and refused ransom for prisoners, as he
preferred holding them for the pleasure of torture.
His unfortunate sister Emma was abbess of
Almenèches; and in 1102, when Robert had been
driven out of England, he descended upon her abbey
and burnt it, meantime occupying the castle of
Exmes.</p>

<p>At one time he had in his possession the strongholds
of Alençon, Bellême, “Domfront, St Cevery,
Essai, La Motte, Pontorson, Mamers, Vignes, and
very many more.”</p>

<p>Robert had been in every Norman war occurring
since he was of an age to bear arms, and his personal
vigour had made him worth something to the cause
he espoused. He married Agnes, daughter and
heiress of Guy, Count of Ponthieu, the same into
whose hands Harold had fallen, and he subsequently
became Count of Ponthieu; also, he succeeded his
brother as Earl of Shrewsbury, in England. When
he was tired of his diversions in Normandy, he
returned to England, seized and held his forfeited castle
of Shrewsbury, until he was forced to surrender, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
second time exiled. He came to a fitting end, for
having, by joining in the rebellion of Fulk of Anjou
against King Henry of England, proved himself a
traitor, he had the audacity to go as an envoy from
the French king to Henry, who, with poetical justice
rather than in accordance with the laws of nations,
seized him and kept him a prisoner, out of the way of
further mischief, until his death. The little town of
Bellême, twelve miles south from Mortagne, was the
original home of the family from which this promising
branch sprang. The highest part of the hill is
crowned by houses, but beneath there are still underground
vaults, and wall foundations belonging to the
mighty castle of the Bellêmes or Belesmes.</p>

<p>At St Saturnin, near Séez, in this district,
Charlotte Corday was born, but her later life was so
closely associated with Caen, that she is there
mentioned more fully.</p>

<p>Westward is the large town of Alençon, which
marks the border of Normandy in this direction.
Alençon has been famous since the reign of Louis
XIV. for its beautiful point lace, and the industry is
still carried on, though to a less extent than before.
The lace is made of pure linen thread, worth £100
per lb., and is composed of ten different stitches,
which are specialities done by different workers.</p>

<div id="ip_110" class="figcenter" style="width: 509px;"><img src="images/i_206.jpg" width="509" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">LACE MAKING</div></div>

<p>The usual earning for this highly-skilled labour
is about 1s. a day. The castle of Alençon was
destroyed, all but the keep, by Henri IV. of
France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Of the famous siege of Alençon we have already
spoken.</p>

<p>Here must come to an end this rather rambling
chapter, designed to cover a district which, with the
exception of Falaise, is comparatively little known by
the English visitor to Normandy.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="subhead">BAYEUX AND THE SMALLER TOWNS</span></h2>

<p>Some old established shops there are, with prestige
so secure that they do not have recourse to the art
known as “dressing the windows”; it is the customers
who seek them out, not they who try to attract
the customers. Something of this kind may be
said of Bayeux, for of all simple unpretending
towns it is the chief; anyone who entered the long
straggling street unforewarned, would imagine that
he was in some humble village, and yet Bayeux
ranks high among Norman towns. After Rouen,
admittedly the capital, and Caen, so much larger
than herself, she assuredly, for importance, antiquity,
and all those things that go to make the fame of
a city, comes third.</p>

<p>The first sight of the cathedral strikes one with
astonishment; it is so composite, so decorative,
that it takes one’s breath away. There is a feeling of
hopelessness&mdash;one will never be able to understand
it. And even after some study it remains almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
impossible to analyse the architecture as one
generally can analyse a cathedral, setting down
the nave to one age, the choir to another, and
perhaps the western towers to a third.</p>

<p>The great central tower rests on a square
decorated platform, and is carried up two lantern
stages above it; the top one is surmounted by a
copper cupola. The upper stage was added in
1860, and is unfortunately quite ugly. Features
which add much to the appearance of the exterior
are the richly decorated portals; that of the south
transept is carved with figures representing scenes
in the life of St Thomas à Becket, who at the time it
was done had been dead for more than thirty years,
and was among the most popular of saints. The
great portal at the west end, however, surpasses it in
beauty; in it are no less than five doorways, diminishing
in size from the centre; and seen beneath the
fine western towers, it forms a feature in a view of
the exterior by no means the least attractive.</p>

<p>The oldest church on this site was burnt down
in 1046, and rebuilt by Bishop Odo, Arlotta’s son
by her second marriage. It was consecrated with
great ceremony in the same year as St Etienne
of Caen, and in the beginning of the next century
again suffered by fire. But the greater part of the
cathedral as we see it, dates from the reconstruction
in 1205 by an Englishman named Henry
Beaumont, and as has been said, the tower was
only completed recently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
It is well to enter from the west, and to seat
oneself at the very end of the nave, in order to
observe best the cathedrals greatest peculiarity,
namely, the strange carving on the spandrils and
interstices of the pillars. The patterns vary from
diaper work to overlapping scales, and clothe the
walls richly. Between the arches are shields with
the strangest collection of figures, a dragon, an
Anglo-Saxon man, and other devices, showing a
wide range of thought on the part of the sculptor.
The pillars themselves, which rise into Norman
arches, are all of one pattern, what may be called
the fascicle or bundle of small shafts forming one
whole. As in every church whose growth ran
throughout several centuries, the Early Pointed
style caps the Norman work; and here pointed
clerestory windows rise above those splendid
arches. The arches are decorated with various
devices, among which we see an unsurpassed example
of the beakhead moulding. The choir stands over
the crypt, and both the transepts are on the
lower level&mdash;a beautiful idea, which gives an
appearance of loftiness and elegance in looking up
toward the east. The vista is, however, unfortunately
blocked by a heavy altar at the chancel
step. This peculiarity in the level of the choir,
and the fantastic carving in stone, are the two
most notable features in the building, as the
stained glass is not very attractive.</p>

<div id="ip_114" class="figcenter" style="width: 533px;"><img src="images/i_214.jpg" width="533" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">AN ANCIENT INN YARD</div></div>

<p>It was in this great church that William wrested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
from Harold the deadly oath on which he partly
based his own right to the throne of England&mdash;an
oath extorted by fear and partly by fraud, and the
breaking of which, by even the most malevolent
of Harold’s foes could hardly be accounted to him
for wickedness. The scene is depicted in the
Bayeux tapestry, fully described in the next chapter.</p>

<p>On this same wide green space there is a statue
to Alain Chartier the poet, a native of Bayeux,
the “most distinguished Frenchman of letters in
the fifteenth century,” who also bears the reputation
of having been the ugliest man of his time.
He was born at Bayeux between 1380&ndash;90, and
became highly popular by his verse. Margaret,
wife of the Dauphin, is said to have kissed him
as he lay asleep, for the sake of all the beautiful
things that had proceeded from his lips; and it is
probably the record of that kiss rather than his
poems which has kept his memory alive.</p>

<p>One of the charms of Bayeux is the number of
its famous old carved houses, which more than
anything else carry us back into the streets of the
past. One of the most notable of these, with
innumerable statues on its frontage, is to be seen
in the Rue St Malo, another, plain but very substantial,
and having several features of its own
tending to give it individuality, is in the Rue St
Martin.</p>

<p>This is at the corner of the main street, and
turning up it we may go to the open space where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
the market is held. If we are fortunate enough to
visit the town on a Saturday, we shall see this
long, narrow, cobble-paved street literally flecked
with the little tight white caps, which are all that
remains of the national headdress. These are not
worn by very young girls, but are assumed after
the first communion, when the child is supposed to
have become a young woman. The fact of wearing
the first “bonnette,” as the cap is called, is very
serious, and not to be lightly considered. The
invariable style is that the hair should be neatly
parted in the middle and smoothed back, flattened
down, while a tight-fitting bit of muslin is drawn
over the head and set into a band of muslin, which
is again mounted on one of plain black velvet; the
only jaunty part of the headdress is the white
muslin bow at the back, which bobs up and down
like a rabbits scut, and when a number of women
are talking together, the bobbing sometimes becomes
quite laughable.</p>

<p>The rest of the women’s costume is of the
usual peasant type, stuff jacket-bodices or blouses;
full, all-round stuff skirts, well off the ground; check
aprons of blue, or mauve, or grey, and among them
all there is a strong family likeness. We see the
same good-humoured commonplace face again and
again; there is shrewdness in the keen eyes and
sensible mouths, health in the smooth brown-red
cheeks, and a certain comeliness notwithstanding the
homely features. One feels sure that if one asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
a question an intelligent answer would be given,
for these women habitually use their brains as well
as their hands in all their daily occupations. Here
and there one sees a young girl with a much fluted
upstanding edging to her cap, and perhaps a pair
of white muslin strings elaborately tied under her
chin, but where such a one appears she is recognised
as being uncommonly fashionable, and respectfully
admiring glances follow her self-conscious figure.</p>

<p>The men in this district have a great partiality
for pearl buttons about the size of a sixpence, with
which they stud the fronts of their smocks, sometimes
in double and treble rows. They are big,
broad-shouldered fellows these brothers by blood to
the men of the Côtentin, and are more akin to
ourselves than to the Frenchmen of Rouen, for the
Danish blood and speech lingered on in Bayeux
when the west of Normandy had been Frenchified.</p>

<p>The market is surrounded by a thick hedge of
limes, and here is sold the usual assortment of
everything in daily use, from boots to bonnet pins.
The only thing which would strike a stranger as
novel are the enormous masses of butter, fitted into
cylindrical hampers, and so heavy that it takes two
men to move them at all.</p>

<p>Later on the crowd thins down, and a steady
stream sets in toward the station. The women
laden with enormous baskets carried by leather
straps, and sometimes holding large red cotton
umbrellas, compare notes as to the days events.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
At the station nearly every one, man and woman
alike, invests in a paper for Sunday reading before
they disperse to their homes on the flat plains of
the Bessin. Some to go to homely cottages, others
it may be to those castles fallen from their high
estate, such as Argouges, once the fortress-dwellings
of the highest nobles in the land.</p>

<p>Less than ten miles westward from Bayeux is
Formigny, one of the historic battlefields of
Normandy; it ranks with Val-ès-Dunes, Tinchebray,
and Mortèmer. It was in 1450, when all
Upper Normandy was already in the hands of
Charles VII. of France, that a desperate effort was
made to save Lower Normandy from the same fate.
The English landed at Cherbourg and marched on
into the Bessin; they were met and defeated at
Formigny, and the battle was the final stroke that
severed Normandy from England.</p>

<p>In a book like the present it would be as difficult
as it would be futile to attempt to give in detail
an account of every town. Those already described
give the atmosphere of the country, and to go
further would be wearisome, or lead to repetition,
for in many of the towns the same features reappear.
In Lisieux, prettily situated amid its broken green
hills, we have a fine cathedral, which shares to the
full in that irregularity so often found in Norman
churches. One tall spire springs from a platform
base, and its companion ends in a conical stumpy
gable. The manufacturing part of the town lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
mostly south of the railway, and the wonderful
carved wooden houses which attract visitors from
all parts reproduce the best features of those
already noted elsewhere.</p>

<p>In a town like Evreux, we may see the
narrow streets and cool green sun-shutters, with the
stately cathedral rising over the roofs, its grey
majesty softened to beauty by the lace-like fretwork.
Down by a canal-like feeder of the river Iton,
in a part reminiscent of the Cambridge “backs,” is
the Allée des Soupirs, under whispering limes; by
the river also are the washing-sheds, with tiled
floors, where women and girls wring and beat and
twist all day long, chattering the while, as if the
perpetual dipping of hands and arms in the ice-cold
water and the bending of backs were a mere
game. Under the limes on a market day the usual
Norman crowd can be seen. The prevailing tone
of colour is blue&mdash;blue blouses, blue bodices, blue
check aprons. Now and then a gendarme strolls
down the centre, looking like a gorgeously coloured
fly in his bright uniform. All the promenaders
passing to and fro are in list slippers, which speaks
volumes for the dryness of the climate; and none
of the women wear hats, and only a few caps or
folded cotton handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>The typical Norman town is for the most part
irregularly built; we do not find the formal squares
and straight streets to be met with in Touraine.
There is almost always a cathedral, varying a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
in its beauty, but at the worst wonderful. There
is very often a barracks, and an open dusty space
for the drill; and the other public buildings, the
Préfecture, and Palais de Justice, if the town be
the centre of its district, the Hotel de Ville, the
public library, the Musée, the Mairie, according to
its status. There is generally a river, sometimes
very small, and an open space or two wherein
wayfarers may sit.</p>

<p>We may spring northwards to Pont Audemer,
where we shall find some features in common with
many Norman towns, and some peculiar to itself.
We may go there on a Monday, for Monday is
market day, and we shall find the wide street before
the splendid old church filled with stalls&mdash;indeed, here,
as ever in Normandy, the wonder is, where everyone
is a vendor, who buys; perhaps it is a disguised form
of barter. The men are good-looking as a rule,
though the strong admixture of French blood has
produced a race in which there are few of the
characteristics of their countrymen further west.
One sees all sorts, of course, but the type which
might be selected as predominant is that of a slightly
built, fairly tall man, with straight marked features,
abundant hair showing strong tendency to curl, on
head and lips; dark eyed and dark complexioned,
good-looking, merry genial fellows, they are a sun-loving
race. It makes a splendid picture this
open-air market. The church with its great tower
at the west end, carved and enriched, speaks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
richest period of the fifteenth century. By the grand
western door are many decorative niches for saints,
now empty.</p>

<p>Perhaps the western sun has fallen sufficiently to
cast the long shadows of the odd medley of houses
facing the cathedral over the rough cobbled street,
and thereby to render the contrast of all that gallant
fretwork, picked out, illuminated, and gilded by his
splendour, all the grander. Within, the church is
magnificent&mdash;and heartrending. Surely never in
any other Catholic church, where loving hands are
usually ready to perform devout offices, was more
dirt seen.</p>

<p>There is rich stained glass of the fifteenth century
in the side aisles. But for those who prefer their
architecture unembellished, there is plenty here. The
chancel was built at least two centuries before the
nave, and is plain indeed. Heavy and solid
arches, comparatively low, and somehow lacking the
grace that usually appertains to this style, enclose
the chancel. The singularly low central arch is not
in line with the nave.</p>

<p>The main street crosses a narrow bridge, beneath
which the quickly running current of the Rille or
Risle flows. Both above and below, there is such
a medley of picturesqueness and decay as surely
never was seen more condensed before.</p>

<p>Gable-ended, timber-framed houses, with projecting
stories, overhang the flood; beams discoloured
and all but fallen to pieces, jut out in all directions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
here the red brick walls catch a glimmer of the
departing sun, there the flap of a bit of wet linen
reveals a kneeling woman in one of the little washing-places
on the lip of the river. Here a thatched gable
projects like a huge hood; there black darkness shows
a tiny court.</p>

<div id="ip_122" class="figcenter" style="width: 453px;"><img src="images/i_230.jpg" width="453" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">VALLEY OF THE RILLE</div></div>

<p>Some fifteen miles from Pont Audemer, in the
valley of the Rille, are the ruins of the famous
Abbey of Bec, which takes rank with the Jumièges
and Fécamp, and others of their class. There is
no remnant of the first great abbey; what are called
the monastic buildings, date from the seventeenth
century; they are now used as a depôt for military
stores. The tower and part of the church, rebuilt
in the fifteenth century, are, however, standing,
but the greater part of this magnificent building
“one of the finest of its kind in France,” was overthrown
at the Revolution. Bec is so closely
associated with the names of its two great abbots,
Lanfranc and Anselm, successive Archbishops of
Canterbury, that it is impossible to pass them over
here without mention. Lanfranc was an Italian,
born at Pavia in the first years of the eleventh
century. He had a genius for attracting and
influencing young men with a desire for learning,
and his following was soon a large one. He
crossed over into France and settled at Avranches,
where he founded a college. In the course of a
journey to Rouen he was seized and robbed in the
woods near Jumièges, and was left bound to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
tree for the whole night. In the morning when
released, he found, not far off, a humble abbey
which had been raised by the piety of one Herlouin.
He was greatly influenced by this incident, and
abandoned his scholastic career to become a monk.
But his great genius for teaching could not be
hidden; scholars flocked to him, and as all the
money he earned by this avocation went into the
common fund, the monastery grew and flourished.
But the holy man had a bitter tongue, and he
made enemies who maligned him to Duke William,
so that at last he was sentenced to banishment.
The well-known story goes that Lanfranc, stumbling
along on a worn old horse, met the duke, who caused
him to be upbraided for not having already gone;
he made answer in all good humour, that if the
duke would give him a better horse he would
depart faster. William was pleased with his ready
wit, and did not forget him. While in Rome, the
prelate was able to be of some service to his royal
master in pleading his cause with the Pope, who
was angry with William for marrying his cousin,
and when the two great abbeys of Caen were
built in expiation of this fault, Lanfranc was
installed as first abbot in St Etienne. He then
became Archbishop of Rouen, and after the Conquest,
Archbishop of Canterbury. During his rule
a fire destroyed the cathedral at Canterbury, and
the rebuilding was due to him. In the new cathedral
he crowned William II. in 1087. Two years later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
he died. His great successor, Anselm, was some
thirty years younger; he was also an Italian, born
at Aosta; he followed very closely in Lanfranc’s
steps, going first to Avranches, and then to Bec,
where he succeeded Lanfranc in the abbacy. It
was he for whom William cried in his last illness;
but Anselm was also ill, and could not travel
speedily, and the king was dead before his arrival.
He was forced by William II. to accept the
Archbishopric of Canterbury, but he shrank so
much from the office that it is said the pastoral
staff was actually thrust into his hand, and his
fingers savagely closed upon it so that he could
not drop it. His quarrels with William II. belong
to the history of England. He died in 1109.</p>

<div id="ip_124" class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><img src="images/i_236.jpg" width="550" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">ST LO</div></div>

<p>Passing now to the west of Normandy, we find
St Lo, Coutances, Granville, and Avranches forming
a group with features in common. They are all
picturesque, all worth seeing; but with the exception
of Avranches, poised upon its rock, there is
no peculiar feature which, like the Bayeux tapestry,
the carved houses at Lisieux, and the twin abbeys
of Caen, draws visitors. St Lo is on different levels,
and the river Vire which flows through it is of a
considerable width for a Norman river, therefore
pretty peeps can be seen in many directions. There
is, of course, a cathedral, dating from thirteenth to
fifteenth centuries, and also an old church, named,
so the story goes, in accordance with the advice
of St Thomas à Becket, who was passing through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
the town while it was being built. He suggested
it should be dedicated to the first saint who should
shed his blood for the Church, and as he was
himself murdered shortly afterwards, the dedication
was made to him.</p>

<p>Not far from St Lo is the Forest of Cerisy,
mentioned in connection with the Chateau of Bur.
At Cerisy an abbey was founded by Robert,
father of the Conqueror, and the church, which
still stands, is in use, a plain and grand building
resembling St Etienne. Coutances has also a
cathedral and an ancient church. Its name is
derived from Constantia, which we see in slightly
different form in the Côtentin, derived from the
adjective Constantinus, which occurred in its description,
“pagus Constantinus.” Coutances is the seat
of a bishopric, and its bishops played no small part
in the stirring times of old. Its bishop, Geoffrey,
blessed the Norman host on its march from Senlac
to Hastings. He was made Earl of Northumbria,
and his estates spread through thirteen shires;
“his flock and his see were little thought of.” The
cathedral which stands now is later than his time.
The principal features are its towers, the central
one, octagonal in shape, is interesting and striking,
and the two towers ending in spires at the west
end, themselves spring from a forest of smaller
spires. The cathedral has been called the most
beautiful church in Normandy. Coutances was for
long considered the chief town of the Côtentin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
which nominally extends so far south as to include
it as well as Granville. Passing on to Granville,
we find a coast town built on the side of a rocky
promontory, and having quays and jetties and a
small lighthouse. The chief charms of Granville
are in its views over the bay, and the possibility
of visiting the Isles of Chausey.</p>

<p>Of Avranches there is much more to say; with
it we enter the district of the Avranchin, which now,
with the Côtentin, is included in La Manche. The
town stands, to begin with, on an extraordinary
hill, the spur or outpost of a range; it rises
sheer from the railway at its foot: a situation to
arrest the attention and stimulate memory. Then
its views of the islands of Tombelaine and Mont
St Michel are unrivalled, and, seen as they may
be against the glory of a western sky, the setting
is worthy of the jewels. Avranches has claims to
historical memories of its own. On a spot known
as the platform, and embracing a wide prospect
of sea and sky, we find a stone inscribed to the
effect that it was part of the threshold on which
Henry II. knelt in humble penitential garb to be
absolved from the curse of excommunication brought
upon him by the murder of Becket. This is preserved
from the ruins of the cathedral which, unlike
most of the solid work of early Norman times, did
not stand the test of time, but partly fell down,
and had to be wholly dismantled in 1799.</p>

<div id="ip_126" class="figcenter" style="width: 492px;"><img src="images/i_242.jpg" width="492" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">A STREET IN GRANVILLE</div></div>

<p>To this town may be accredited the honour of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
having produced the first poet laureate, for a poet
named Henry of Avranches so attracted the notice
of Henry III., that he gave him a pension and
attached him to the court.</p>

<p>Avranches was from very early times noted
for its magnificent and valuable library, but in
1899 a fire broke out and destroyed many priceless
MSS., among them a copy of Domesday Book
in three colours.</p>

<p>There are still, however, 16,000 volumes in
the Public Library. These public libraries are
notable features in almost every town in Normandy;
they do not quite correspond with the English
libraries of the same heading, but rather with the
cathedral or chapter libraries attached to some of
our diocesan towns, and they usually have owed
their foundation to the monks, for abbeys were
in early times the chief seats of learning. They
frequently contain very valuable MSS., and nearly
always have some treasures to show. The reference
rooms are lofty, well furnished, and convenient, and
strangers are freely admitted. At Rouen the
library contains 133,000 volumes and 3600 MSS.,
including several service books and missals written
in the eleventh century in the Anglo-Saxon style.
One missal belonged to Robert of Jumièges, who
became Archbishop of Canterbury, and to whose
chronicles we owe so much of our knowledge of
early Norman history; there is a Benedictional of
988, written for Æthelgar, Bishop of Selsey, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
the earliest printed book is of the year 1468. The
origin of the library is obscure. At the end of the
twelfth century it is first mentioned as containing
160 volumes; in 1200 it was partly destroyed.
The library at Bayeux holds 30,000 volumes, and
that at Caen 100,000 volumes and 800 MSS.
Other figures are&mdash;Lisieux, 28,000; Cherbourg,
30,000; Valognes, 20,000; Havre, 30,000, with
eighth and ninth century MSS. These libraries
are often housed in a part of the building of the
Hotel de Ville, and should certainly be seen by any
visitor who has half an hour to spare in passing
through any of the above towns.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="subhead">THE FAMOUS TAPESTRY</span></h2>

<p>There is not a school child in England who has
not heard of the marvellous piece of work supposed
to have been wrought by Queen Matilda and the
ladies of her court; but until the tapestry is actually
seen, the conception of it is as vague as that of
giants and fairies. As a matter of fact, the
work is not tapestry at all, but crewel work. Real
tapestry resembles carpet, and is closely worked, and
the background is all filled in; but this of Bayeux
is lightly worked in worsted, on a strip of linen about
two hundred and thirty feet in length by about twenty
inches in breadth, and is placed on a stand, ingeniously
arranged, so that by walking round the outside
and inside the whole strip can be seen without trouble,
and in itself remains intact.</p>

<p>The question whether Queen Matilda and the
ladies of William’s court really were the authors of
this marvellous record in needlework will, with such
subjects as the authorship of the <i>Letters of Junius</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
always remain unanswered. There are arguments
for and against; the fact that the tapestry was
designed for the glorification of William, looks as
if it were executed in his lifetime, and the disproportionate
importance attached to the smallest
events in the campaign in Brittany, which are given
with more detail and fidelity than even in the
chronicles, looks as if that campaign must have
been contemporary, and was depicted with that
disregard for proportion which is ever the effect
of seeing an affair in the foreground. The minute
details given in the case of the figures look also as
if they were done from personal knowledge&mdash;details
such as the fact that Edward the Confessor is always
represented with a beard, and that the Saxons wear
moustaches, while the Frenchmen are clean shaven.
In the reign of the Conqueror’s successor, the
Normans themselves cultivated beards, and allowed
the hair to grow; and anyone working tapestry at
that date would surely never have been realistic
enough to depart from the fashions he saw around
him to depict those which had preceded them. Later
on, also, other little points, such as immoderately
peaked shoes, were adopted; these are not shown
in the tapestry, though had the work been done later
than the Conqueror’s reign, the fashions would have
been those of the then prevailing mode.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are serious arguments
against Matilda’s being the designer, though they
are mostly negative; for instance, the tapestry is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
mentioned in her will, neither does it find a place
in the inventory of the goods belonging to the
church at Bayeux in 1369, though it is mentioned
in that made in 1476, from which the inference is
drawn that it was not in existence at the earlier
date. But, on the other hand, it may well have
been overlooked. By some it is supposed to have
been executed for the cathedral of Bayeux by Bishop
Odo’s command, and it is a fact that in length it
exactly fits the circuit of the choir walls, where it
might have been hung on feast days.</p>

<p>It was in 1724 that attention was first drawn
to the tapestry, which until then had been lying
unnoticed at Bayeux. There was a drawing of it
in the Cabinet of Antiquities at Paris, and M. Lancelot
coming across this was struck by it, and searched
for the original, though he was quite uncertain what
material it was in, whether it were a fresco, a sculpture,
or a piece of needlework. It was unearthed at last
at Bayeux, and was kept in a side chapel at the
cathedral rolled around a mighty spool, whence it
was unrolled once a year. In 1803, when Buonaparte
meditated an invasion of England, the tapestry was
brought to France with a view to stimulating the
spirits of the French by pointing out to them what
had been done might be done again. Subsequently,
the much better plan of preserving the work from
injury and enabling it to be seen, which is at
present in use, was adopted. The case is glazed,
so that the tapestry may stand for as many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
hundred years as it has already stood, without perceptible
injury.</p>

<p>The worsted in which it is worked is as fresh as
the day it was first used, and its brightness against
the light background contrasts very strongly with
the dingy hues of the tapestry one is accustomed to
see. The colours used are drabs and greens, russets
and blues, all art colours, and extraordinarily effective.
The shadows are treated in a very original manner:
for instance, when it is desired to show the inside of
a horse’s leg in shadow, the leg is filled in in a
different colour from that of the horse’s body; it is
technically supposed to represent a shadow, and
this does very well.</p>

<p>There is a border decorated by grotesque beasts
and heraldic figures, and the border has sometimes
to give way to the exigencies of the story, when an
exceptionally tall man or a large ship has to encroach
upon it.</p>

<p>The drama begins long before the Norman
Conquest, and is told with a verve and humour quite
unexpected; whether it were Matilda who was the
designer, or the wives of those “natives of Normandy
on whom William had bestowed lands in England,”
as the writer in the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>
thinks, the authors must have had plenty of
character, and strong indeed must their freshness
have been to resist the withering dulness of the life
then deemed meet for women. And freshness they
had in full measure, for no one could have depicted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
the lugubrious roundness of Harold’s face, and the
quaint expressions of the horses, who did not delight
in the work.</p>

<p>The first scene shows King Edward the Confessor
commissioning Harold to visit Normandy. Harold’s
object was nominally to obtain the release of his
nephews held prisoners by William, but it is supposed
that Edward the Confessor had his own reasons for
sending him into William’s power, as he feared
Harold, and really desired William to be his heir
in England. If this were so, William certainly took
the advantage thus given to him, and played his
cards with conspicuous skill. We are carried through
Harold’s journey to the coast, his voyage, his wreck,
and his subsequent capture by Guy, Count of Ponthieu.
It may be noted that the hawks, which can be seen
on the wrists of the characters, are not hooded,
another small indication as to date, for hawks began
to wear hoods about 1200, so that the work must
have been executed before then. When Harold
follows Guy as a prisoner, his hawk sits reversed
upon his wrist, a sign of dejection, while that of Guy
looks forward in the usual way. At the repeated
solicitation of William, who backed his request with
the present of a considerable slice of territory, Harold
is next brought to him as a prisoner by the triumphant
Guy, who points to him, as much as to say, “See
what I have done!” However, William receives
him as a guest, and brings him to his palace. The
leading characters in this drama are by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
lay figures; Harold can be easily recognised by his
round face and vacuous expression; he is smaller than
William, who is heavy jawed and strong. In the
beasts on the border we see the same spirit which
is to be found more developed in the gargoyles on
churches, a spirit full of mischief and appreciation of
what may be called the “weird grotesque.”</p>

<p>Did some of these ladies who worked, apparently
so patiently and submissively, get rid of their feelings
of petty jealousy and spite by working them into the
canvas? Did Edith caricature the knight who was
blind to her charms, and Matilda glorify him who
loved her in secret? It is strange to notice that the
main figures are all men; women very seldom figure
in the play, only three times in fact, and twice they
are nameless. In the next compartment we have the
principal exception, a lady dressed in a nunlike habit
stands in a small kiosk, and a man pats her cheek
condescendingly; the inscription tells us that some
woman named Elgiva conversed with a clerk. The
probable explanation is that this is William’s
daughter Adeliza or Agatha, whom he agreed to give
to Harold in marriage, and it may be that the pleasing
intelligence so jocularly conveyed to her, is that of her
future destiny. Though Adeliza at this date was
only seven or eight years old, she afterwards refused
to marry a Spaniard, on account of her former
betrothal to Harold, and so it seems probable that
she played a part in the drama.</p>

<div id="ip_134" class="figcenter" style="width: 452px;"><img src="images/i_254.jpg" width="452" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">THE SPINNING WHEEL</div></div>

<p>In the next stage Harold assists William in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
expedition to suppress the rebels, Conan, Duke of
Brittany, and the Duke of Anjou. The men are all
represented in chain armour, and their pointed shoes
nearly touch the ground on each side of the horses,
which are small. It may be noted also that the
horses wear no defensive armour, which was not used
until the time of Henry the First. Towns are
symbolised by a kind of dome standing on an arch.
The army passes by Mont St Michel, and at the
river Couesnon, which forms the boundary between
Normandy and Brittany, many of the soldiers come
to grief. The towns of Dol and Rennes are next
passed, and Dinan is besieged. In it Conan is
caught, and is forced to yield to hand out the keys of
the besieged town. Harold is knighted by William
for his prowess on the field. In this section we have
the local touch which gives Bayeux her representation
in the tapestry, for at Bayeux is held a solemn
parliament, whereat Harold acknowledges William
heir to King Edward.</p>

<p>At this time also took place the formal ceremonial
of betrothal between himself and Adeliza, which made
so undying an impression on the child; and which
seemed to Harold merely a part of the game he had
to play, as he took no account of it whatever,
marrying almost directly after his return to England.
The ceremony of the oath, by which he swore to
uphold William’s claim to the English throne, was, if
chroniclers can be believed, of more importance in his
eyes. For a book of the New Testament having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
been laid before him, he swore upon it with a sacred
oath, and then the gold cloth on which it had been
laid was lifted, and there, disclosed to his astonished
eyes, were relics of great sanctity and value,
apparently to him of far more import than the Gospels,
for he started and trembled violently.</p>

<p>Having thus committed himself, he returns to
England and gives an account of his enterprise to
Edward, who soon afterwards dies. There are several
deathbed scenes; indeed we are never quite sure that
we have seen the last of Edward. Two of these
scenes, for reasons of space, are put into one compartment;
that is to say, those representing Edward
on his deathbed, and Edward at the point of death
addressing his courtiers.</p>

<p>It is said that William was hunting in the forest
of Rouvray, near Rouen, when the fact of Harold’s
having assumed the crown was made known to him
by no less a messenger than Tostig, Harold’s own
rebellious brother. William was not the man to
submit quietly; the next scene in the tapestry shows
us the diligent preparations made for the invasion of
England. Normandy maintained no standing navy:
it was necessary to build one. We see men chopping
down trees, which have a striking resemblance to
barnacles upside down. It was in January the news
was brought, and not till the following autumn was
the fleet ready to sail. The smallest details are given
faithfully on the tapestry; we see the ships, when
ready, being drawn down to the shore by ropes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
floated on sinuous waves. The conveyance of the
horses to the English shore threatened a difficulty
from the tapestry-workers’ point of view, but they did
not shirk it. They represented a row of horses’
heads projecting in regular array from the edges of
the boats, and the bodies were left to the imagination,
supposed to be neatly packed away in a space that
would have conveniently held their tails! The
flotilla set sail on September 12th from Dives, but was
driven into St Valery, where it lay until the 27th,
then once more set forward with a favourable
wind.</p>

<p>Harold had himself been by no means idle, his
fleet had cruised the Channel during the summer
months, waiting for the expected foe; but in
September there bore down upon the Yorkshire
coast his brother Tostig, in force, with the support of
Harold Hardrada, so Harold hastened northward to
engage with him, and while he was facing and
subduing this new foe, his fleet, left without a head,
dispersed, and William landed without opposition.
He landed at Pevensey, and we see in the tapestry the
horses, restored to their full size, led ashore; the
ships drawn up in array on the beach, and the establishment
of a camp, with arrangements for plenteous
eating and drinking. On one side we have the
killing of an ox, who regards his executioner with
an expression of pained surprise. This is deliberate;
the lady who worked that ox could have made him
wear any expression she chose. A sheep is also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
sacrificed, and red tongues of flame start up beneath
the cauldrons wherein the food is cooked. Then we
see tables spread, groaning with provender. “The
duke sat down to eat, and the barons and knights
had food in plenty; for they had brought ample store.
All ate and drank enough, and were right glad that
they were ashore.” The fortifying of the camp is
done symmetrically; the men raising the earthworks
take care to have three little dabs or mounds of
earth of equal size upon their spades;&mdash;indeed the
mixture of symmetry and fidelity to detail is remarkable
throughout the work; we generally find that in
following design, truth is lost sight of. A messenger
comes from Harold to William, and in the next scene
hostilities have begun in the burning of a house, in
which are a woman and child&mdash;the third woman in
the piece, the second being present at King Edward’s
deathbed.</p>

<p>Then after all these preliminaries we come to the
climax, the <i>mêlée</i> at Hastings, which occupies fully
a quarter of the whole length of the canvas. These
scenes are extraordinarily fine. All the vigour of
mixed action is shown in the most uncompromising
of materials, wool-work. We have the deaths of
Harold’s two brothers, Leofwine and Gurth; the
encouragement of Bishop Odo of Bayeux; the scene
where William raises his visor to show himself
unhurt; the <i>mêlée</i> where Harold’s army is cut to
pieces. The border consists of a line of more or less
dismembered men lying prostrate, and the ladies’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
highly-developed sense of humour shows itself at
every turn. It is unfortunate that some of these, the
most brilliant of the scenes, are on the inside of the
frame as the tapestry now stands, and cannot be
photographed for lack of light and space.</p>

<p>At last we see Harold in agony drawing the fatal
arrow from his eye; and though he lived for some
hours longer, the news of his death when it came was
the signal for flight, leaving the Normans victors in a
fight which had lasted the whole day. Of Earl
Godwin’s seven sons, two still remained alive after
the battle, but both ended their lives in the seclusion
of a religious house. As we draw to the close of the
great drama the stitches are unfinished, the work left
in many places merely indicated, and the roll is
worn.</p>

<p>We feel a debt of gratitude toward the workers
difficult to express. The tapestry thrills with life: it
is not a mere strip of worked linen, but what we in
these latter days would call a “human document,” and
it has come down through nine hundred years bearing
more detail, more history, on its folds than has ever
been told to us by any monkish parchment or royal
scroll.</p>

<span class="subhead">AN ABBEY ON A ROCK</span></h2>

<p>In spite of all that has been said of the glory of
Mont St Michel, not the half has been told. This
magnificent abbey, palace, citadel, church, remains
unique, no less in its situation than in its stupendous
strength, in its intricate variety than in its architectural
beauty. The solidity and awe-inspiring
grandeur of the Norman work is softened and
enhanced by the delicate tracery of the thirteenth
century; the towering citadel impresses as much by
its elegance as by its strength.</p>

<p>From the heights of Avranches the cliff-fortress
is seen as in a miniature, clearly outlined against
the sapphire sea of summer, set off by the long,
rolling, richly-wooded slopes of the shore. Three
rivers flow into this bay, the Sée, the Sélune, and
the Couesnon, and their channels make long tracks
of shining water over the sands at low tide. The
island of Tombelaine, resembling a couched lion,
serves the same purpose to the Mount as the spire
of St Dunstan’s on Ludgate Hill does to St Paul’s,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
it gives a unit by which to measure the height of
the grander island. But it is impossible to approach
St Michel from Avranches. The only feasible road
is over the sands from the Pontorson side, and to
attain this it is necessary to circle round the forked
bay from Avranches, a proceeding which, as the
way is as bow to string to that across the bay,
makes in all some sixteen miles to be traversed.
But a more startling effect is gained from the
new view thus obtained. For there, growing
larger with every yard we advance toward it,
is the most graceful, most striking, and most
wonderful island in the world! Within the last
thirty or forty years a tower and spire, rising high
into the air, bearing a gilt figure of St Michael, has
been erected at the summit of the rock, and this
has altered the outline considerably, drawing the
eye upward at an angle ending in a sharp point,
instead of to the conical or blunt summit familiar
from old representations. It is impossible to deny
that from an artistic point of view this is an
improvement, however much one may revolt against
modern work being patched on to antiquity.</p>

<p>From the Pontorson road we approach the island,
facing northward, and if we are fortunate enough
to arrive in the evening when the sun is setting
behind the line of sea in the west, we shall see a
gorgeous vision,</p>

<p class="in0">The flame-coloured glowing background shows up
the Mount dark and sombre, yet not wholly unrelieved,
because lit by gleams that catch the facets
and angles innumerable that stud its surface. The
wide stretch of level water gently heaving round
the base gives a strange mystical sense of illimitable
space, and this with the majesty of the rock fills
any who have imagination at all with the same
emotion and sensation of eternity and infinity as is
aroused by the sound of grand music. Yet in the
morning light, glowing with an extraordinary
amethyst hue, the Mount is mystic and wonderful
too; it has then a more joyous and softened beauty;
seen in storm and rain it is forbidding, and the
grandeur alone is predominant; in every season, in
every phase of weather, one or the other of the
characteristics that combine to make up its unsurpassable
glory, its mystery, its grandeur, or its
wonder, start out and proclaim themselves supreme.
So that according to a man’s luck at his first
approach will he be ready to exclaim, “How grand
it is!” “How wonderful!” or “How beautiful!”
The actual road over the sands is about a mile
and a quarter in length. It was made in 1880,
before which time the sands could only be crossed
at low tide. It is built up high, and hedged on
either side by a low wall. It is bare, exposed, and
dusty. Around it lie the wide flats of half-uncovered
sand, resembling those of the Northumbrian coast
near Coquet Island. Yet though this approach in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
itself is slightly chilling to feelings of enthusiasm, its
deficiencies are lost in the vision ahead, which grows
each minute more and more detailed, more and more
vivid. There is in reality only one hotel on the
island to which any ordinary tourist would think of
going. Its message has been proclaimed half a
mile away, for directly mystery began to give way
to detail, it could be seen, in letters six feet high,
on every building of any size that rises up on the
precipitous face of the cliff, that Hotel Poulard Ainé
and its <i>dépendances</i> occupied all the prominent
houses that were available. Some rival establishments
have been set up by other members of the
same family, but their light is a candle to the
electric arc compared with the original Poulard,
famous for its excellent and Brobdingnagian
omelets.</p>

<p>No vehicles enter the gateway of the island, they
stop at the end of the causeway; it would be impossible
for them to effect an entrance, and if they
could they would be of no use in the steep, narrow,
broken street like a Scottish wynd, which is all the
island boasts.</p>

<p>At the end of the causeway a rough platform of
raised boards carries the traveller over an expanse
of slimy mud, and from this he descends by steps
to the gateway.</p>

<p>Once inside the gateway there is a narrow
street with the entrance of the Poulard Hotel on
one side, and small recesses with seats and tables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
for refreshments on the other; while the street itself
is spanned a little higher up by a massive gateway
called La Porte du Roi. In the season the hotel
is generally crammed, and largely by the English.
It is frequently necessary to get put up in one of the
<i>dépendances</i>, and for sheer wonder it is hard to beat
that which stands some fifty feet higher up the cliff.
Entering the main hotel to go to this, one traverses
many flights of stairs, and finally, coming out by
a wholly unexpected door in the wall, finds oneself
on the rugged face of the cliff, with rough-hewn
stone steps stretching higher still to the number
of fifty or sixty. These lead to a terrace whereon
is a large white and red house; and from the terrace
what a view! Sea and sky, and the great green
scimitar of the French coast, low-lying in the
distance, are the principal components. The <i>dépendance</i>
is built absolutely plumb with the rock, so by
leaning out of one of the long French windows in
the front, one might fling a pebble into the murmuring
lapping water below; and at night when above
gleams “the intense clear star-sown vault of heaven,”
and below the tide steals up, and there arises the
gentle sucking of the tethered boats, one might well
imagine oneself in Mohammed’s coffin, swung between
heaven and earth.</p>

<div id="ip_144" class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;"><img src="images/i_272.jpg" width="419" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">LA PORTE DU ROI</div></div>

<p>Such are a few of the glories of the Mount when
first approached; but the reverse side of the medal
quickly shows itself. It is impossible to be there
for a couple of hours without feeling oneself in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
cage. To begin with, the mountain, like the moon,
shows only one face, and try as one will, it is but
unsatisfactory glimpses one can get of the other.
Full of the ardour of discovery the visitor starts
out. The little, crooked, narrow main street, if
street it can be called, is full of picturesque bits, of
visions of blue sky of an intense and dazzling brightness,
framed in towering irregular walls. But no
time is allowed for enjoyment of these peeps, for in
the tiny shops full of penknives, trinkets, paperweights,
and every atrocity that has ever been
perpetrated under the name of souvenir, the women
are waiting to pounce like spiders on any visitor,
and pester him to buy their wares. There is no
escape. One may pass on quickly, only within a
very short time to be brought up by a high blank
wall, baffled and annoyed, as visions of sitting on a
rocky promontory, and enjoying the quiet evening
light grow more remote. The result of a fresh start is
to find oneself back on a higher level on the terrace
of the <i>dépendance</i>, stopped by the hotel wall, and
the entrance to a Musée, where two officials are no
less persistent than the women in pressing visitors
to come in. One may repeat the experiment, only
to realise that, like Sterne’s starling, one “can’t
get out.” In despair, one goes on to the walls,
broad and flat, and free from shops, with bastion
towers at intervals. For a moment irritation is
quieted by the repetition of the view, for in front
lies the sea, behind, towering into the air, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
marvellous fortress of masonry. At the very end
of the promenade there is a glimpse, over the high
boundary wall, which hems one in so exasperatingly
on the east, of growing trees and cool greenness,
but admittance to this paradise is apparently
unattainable.</p>

<p>In the middle of the day the odours rising from
the insanitary pavements is intolerable; oh for a
torrent of rain! It is marvellous the inhabitants do
not suffer from typhoid fever, but they, like the rest
of their countrymen, seem absolutely impervious to
any ill-effects arising from lack of sanitation.</p>

<p>By this time one has realised that only a strip of
the island, the front facing shorewards, is available;
that the whole of the other side is cut off, and can
only be seen by descending through the main
entrance, and making one’s way at low tide across
the wet sands, and fording numerous tidal rivers <i>en
route</i>. It is difficult to see why doors should not be
pierced in that horrible encircling barrier; a small
charge might even be made, and visitors allowed
access to the slopes beyond; steep they may be, but
it is not beyond human power to cut a few terrace
paths for walking.</p>

<div id="ip_146" class="figcenter" style="width: 456px;"><img src="images/i_278.jpg" width="456" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">THE STREET, MONT ST MICHEL</div></div>

<p>Yet there is still the abbey to be explored, with its
endless ramifications. The wonder grows as it is
examined, how could monks of the thirteenth century,
with no mechanical contrivances, bring the ponderous
blocks of stone across the sands, so treacherous
and often impassable, raise them up five hundred feet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
and plant them so that they stand with an air of
finality, impregnable, unshakable? So steep, so
massive are those walls, that to look up at them
produces almost the same sensation as looking down
over a great height: it makes one giddy. Over one
corner there peeps a bit of lace work in stone, flying
buttresses and decorated pinnacles; old also, older
than the marvellous abbey itself. Below this are two
rounded towers that guard the entrance to the
chatelet. Abbey, fortress, church, and castle, St
Michel comprises them all, and the masonry of the
various buildings is so interwoven, so intricate, that
it is impossible to separate one from the other by
mere external looking. The island is small, but its
abbey is vast, and much as has been said about
it, familiar as are the representations of the Mount,
very little has been written about its internal beauties;
consequently most people go there expecting to
find a ruin, but here is an almost perfect bit of
masonry, perfect in construction and in repair.</p>

<p>The oldest part is the church, which is the pinnacle
or crown of the island, standing at its highest point,
more than four hundred feet above the sea-level. The
first church on this lonely and windswept spot was
built in the eighth century by the Bishop of
Avranches, named Aubert, who declared that St
Michael had appeared to him in a dream, and
commanded him to undertake this task: before that
time the islet had been called Mont de la Tombe, a
name recalled in the isle of Tombelaine near. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
place is called in old charters “St Michel au péril de
la Mer,” and the name must have seemed more fitting
then in its loneliness than now, when connected by
the solid causeway to the mainland. The bishop’s
church was a mere grotto, and of it nothing
remains, though the good man’s own name is
preserved in a little chapel of St Aubert on the
inaccessible southern face of the rock. The
incredible difficulty of the task was quite sufficient to
ensure its repetition, for what man has done man will
do. But the succeeding church, built in the reign of
Duke Richard the Fearless, was swept away by fire,
and the present one is the third on the same site,
built in the course of the eleventh century. The
surprising difficulty of the task may be gauged by
the fact that only a very small part of the building
rests on the solid rock, most of it being founded on a
platform or platforms. It seems curious that the
apex of the rock was not cut down to make a basis
instead of being built up to the required level, but
from whatever reason, the more arduous method was
chosen. The choir fell down in 1421, and was
rebuilt, so that it is of later date than the rest.</p>

<p>Pilgrims had flocked to the shrine built by St
Aubert, and in time a few rough houses clung like
limpets to the sides of the rock, and became the
nucleus of the present village.</p>

<div id="ip_148" class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"><img src="images/i_284.jpg" width="700" height="457" alt="" /><div class="caption">A VIEW FROM THE TOP OF MONT ST MICHEL</div></div>

<p>Below and on each side of the church is the abbey,
justly called La Merveille. This is composed of two
vast buildings, backing on the rock and facing landward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
It was built in the first half of the thirteenth
century, and is one of the most perfect specimens of
the architecture of the time in existence. Of the
same date are the fortifications, ramparts, and
bastions, which transformed the mount into a
fortress and citadel. This tiny rugged island has had
a chequered career. The Mount was the only spot in
the whole of Normandy which defied England when
she ruled the rest of the territory. It was besieged
and attacked again and again without success. The
ancient monks, with as much of the church militant
as the church penitent in them, clung to their bare
sharp rock, and defied the would-be invaders.</p>

<p>The abbot was a personage of great importance;
at the time of the Conquest he fitted out six vessels
for the Norman duke, and for this he was well
rewarded, for monks of the abbey were raised to the
highest ecclesiastical dignities in England. One
became abbot of St Hilda, another of St Peter at
Gloucester, another of Canterbury. Coins, bearing
the image of the Archangel Michael, were struck also
in commemoration of the Conquest.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century the abbot had attained
almost regal power, holding not only the adjacent
isles of Tombelaine and Jersey and Guernsey, but
even the sister isle of Mount St Michael off the
Cornish coast, which had been given to the
monastery by Edward the Confessor.</p>

<p>Tombelaine has a history of its own, independently
of Mont St Michel. In 1048 two monks came and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
took up their abode here to live the contemplative
life, and nearly a hundred years later a priory was
founded on the rock, which was very popular with the
abbots of the neighbouring monastery, so that one of
them was buried here by his own request. After a
while fortifications grew up around the cloistral walls
of the priory, and thus the island was fitted to
become an important strategic base. When the
English seized it in Edward III.’s reign, they saw
its possibilities, and strengthened the fortifications
immensely.</p>

<p>What fortifications there were, remained till 1669,
when they were demolished by order of the King of
France. During the fourteenth century, when war
flamed continually between England and France,
they played a notable part. Mont St Michel itself
was menaced, and though the pilgrims were allowed
to pass to it over the yellow sands without hindrance,
the inhabitants of the Mount were for a year more or
less in a state of siege. But it was not until 1423
that the grand siege began, when pilgrims were
intercepted and turned back, and sallies and counter-sallies
passed between the large and small rock,
crouching like two lions about to spring. Then the
investment became more strict, English vessels
appeared in the shallow waters of the bay, and the
English soldiers thus reinforced, might probably
have succeeded in cracking this very hard nut, had
not the Bretons come to the assistance of the garrison,
and sailing into the bay engaged the English in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
combat. There is little to be gathered of the details
of the fight, but the effect was to make the English
retire hastily to their entrenchments. This was by
no means their last attempt, however, on the island
fastness, for in 1427 a great attack was made under
Lord Scales. It was at this time that the two
cannons which now stand within the gate of the
Mount were taken by the French.</p>

<p>A strange incident is the pilgrimage of 400
children, in the middle of the fifteenth century, to
the Mount, from Germany and Flanders. These
children had left their homes without the consent,
and in many cases against the wishes, of their
parents. The sight must have been an impressive
one as the little pilgrims, travel-worn and stained,
saw at length their goal, and crossed the shifting
sands toward it. What became of them afterwards
is not recorded, whether they returned to
their homes or settled down in the country near,
but the actual fact of the pilgrimage seems well
attested, though the numbers taking part in it
must be received with caution.</p>

<p>In the reign of Louis the Eleventh, the island
was made into a state prison, and continued to be
so more or less until 1863. During the French
Revolution many of those called “enemies of the
Republic” were incarcerated here, in deep and
vaulted dungeons from which there was no possibility
of escape. The buildings are now government
property, and admittance is nominally free,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
as the officials who show strangers round are paid
by the State; but a tip is also expected! The
system is another of those annoying little arrangements
which so mar the pleasure of a visit to the
island. The guardian of the abbey waits until
he has collected a sufficient party, say thirty or
forty people, and then leads them through from
room to room, locking each door behind him, and
pouring forth a voluble string of monotonous words
in the very worst “guide” style.</p>

<p>So intricate is the architecture, so numerous
the rooms, halls, and corridors, that a description
in detail of the whole of the building is impossible,
nevertheless one or two points stand vividly out in
the mind. One is the marvellous flight of steps
beneath the archway by which entrance is obtained;
another, the winding stone staircase, called L’Escalier
de Dentelle, by which one mounts to a platform
running round the exterior of the choir beneath
the flying buttresses, with their delicate turrets and
pinnacles; another, the wide panorama seen from
any of the platforms around the church. The
church itself is half Norman, half Pointed, and the
nave, with its solid pillars and rounded arches
contrasts with the later decorative work in the
choir. Nor is the crypt beneath&mdash;rightly called
the Crypt of the Great Pillars&mdash;less interesting.
These stupendous columns, planted in couples,
support the whole fabric, and their colossal strength
strikes one with wonder and awe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
The abbey is in three stories, the highest
containing the dormitory and cloister, and the
second two vast halls, while in the lowest are the
almonry, and endless vaults.</p>

<p>The cloisters are the most perfect of their kind
in Europe, and strike one the more imperiously
from their delicate and almost fragile beauty amid
much that is so stern and massive. They were
made in the early part of the thirteenth century,
and the twenty-first abbot, Raoul de Villedieu, was
the designer. The cloisters consist of a double
row of slender columns of polished granite round
an interior courtyard, and the rows are placed so
that the columns in each do not coincide with one
another in the line of vision, but interlace. Within
the narrow passage between the rows are ribs,
admirably and symmetrically disposed, connecting
the two, and in the spandrils of the exterior rows
there is carving of fruit and foliage of such fairy-like
delicacy, that it is almost impossible to believe
it was executed seven centuries ago. The cloister
was “restored” 1877&ndash;81.</p>

<p>The dormitory, which is reached from the cloister,
is vast, and has an arcade of deeply-set lancet
windows on each side, to the numbers of thirty-one
and twenty-six. This is of slightly later date
than the cloister. In the Salle des Chevaliers on
the floor below a raised terrace runs along one
side, and there are two carved mantelpieces, while
the ribbed roof is supported by pillars with carved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
capitals. The same profusion of space and detail
is noticeable everywhere. The refectory adjoining
shows fireplace, ribbed roof, and graceful columns
also, and was finished about 1215. There are nine
large mullioned windows. Each hall varies, yet
all are animated by the same spirit of artistic
loving care. In the lowest storey there is the ancient
cloister, superseded by the work of Villedieu, and
also a beautiful crypt with short thick pillars, and
a delicately groined roof.</p>

<p>One carries away loving memories of all this
beauty, embodying so much strength and thought
and care; one forgets, as one always does forget,
the herding together, the sense of imprisonment,
the disagreeable sights and sounds; and one thinks
of this island, standing alone, and rising from the
bosom of the sea, as one thinks of some glorious
picture well-known and loved. It is said that
once all this bay was clothed with wood; that the
island was no island; and rumour whispers now
that the bay is to be reclaimed, the land planted
and cultivated, and the island be an island no
more; may it be but lying rumour, and not based
on any foundation, for the day that St Michel
ceases to be an island, that day will she have been
robbed of half her beauty and nearly all her charm.
Long may it stand, that church-citadel, graceful,
stern, and solitary “St Michel in peril of the Sea.”</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="subhead">THE STORMY CÔTENTIN</span></h2>

<p>This is an age of travel, and many persons are
searching diligently for some district intrinsically
interesting and desirable, not too much overrun by
their kind, and above all not too inaccessible,
wherein they may take a holiday. Such a district
there is in the Côtentin peninsula jutting out from
the north coast of France, one of the only two
peninsulas in Europe, by the way, which do point
in that direction. It is not only in position that the
Côtentin resembles Denmark, but also in race; here
and here alone in Normandy may still be found
men of the same blood as the Conqueror.</p>

<p>In conformation the Côtentin peninsula is akin
to Brittany, being almost entirely of granite, which
ancient formation extends over the whole district,
with the exception of a strip south of La Hogue,
on the western coast. The landscape is such as is
generally found in granite countries, broken and
varied, with stern coasts and massive cliffs, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
are continually breaking away and letting the sea
eat into the land. It is said that at one time
Jersey was divided by only a narrow river from
the mainland, and now with the recession of the
coast it is far out to sea. Not only in scenery
is the Côtentin a delightful place for a holiday, but
in more unusual attractions. Its heights and
hollows are studded with architectural remains,
proud and stern chateaux, now for the most part
occupied as farmhouses; its annals are as full of
skirmishes and romantic stories as our own border
country. Within a ten-mile radius of Valognes to
the west and south, we find the chateaux of St
Martin le Hebert, Bricbecque, Nehou, Vicomte
St Sauveur, Crosville, Urville, and Flottemanville.
Further south are the ruins of the ancient castle of
La Haye du Puits. Of all these, Bricbecque and
St Sauveur are the best known. Bricbecque stands
up stern and strong still, a majestic ruin; in its
courtyard is the hotel, and the far-stretching
walls tell of its previous extent. The Sire of
Bricbecque was nearly always at enmity with the
Sire of St Sauveur, and the two regarded each
other with great jealousy. St Sauveur was the
more powerful, and in the time of the Conqueror its
chieftain Neel, or Nigel, held the title of Premier
Baron or Vicomte of the Côtentin. He it was who
joined the conspiracy against William, to whom
his father had been a loyal and true vassal; and
he was among those horsemen who entered Valognes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
by stealth in order to seize William unawares and
assassinate him. The story of the duke’s escape
and the subsequent fight at Val-ès-Dunes has
already been told. Yet after Neel had made his
submission, William forgave him, and in time
restored him to his castle, though the lands which
Neel had held in Guernsey were handed over to
the Church as an act of reparation. In this was
only completed what his father had begun, for the
elder Neel had given largely to the Church.</p>

<div id="ip_157" class="figcenter" style="width: 454px;"><img src="images/i_296.jpg" width="454" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">A HOLIDAY HEAD-DRESS</div></div>

<p>Neel’s line ended in a daughter, who carried the
castle by marriage to Tesson Jourdain, and from
the Jourdains it passed, also by marriage, to the
Harcourts. In the reign of Edward III. of
England, the chieftain Harcourt rebelled against
the French king, and joined Edward in his attempts
on France. He was once pardoned, but again
turned traitor, and was finally killed fighting
gallantly enough with his back against a tree, all
alone in the midst of the soldiers sent to take him
by the King of France. After his death the castle
continued in the hands of the English, under Sir
John Chandos, who built the splendid keep or
tower which still stands; and when Sir John fell, his
company held on until, in 1372, the whole force of
France was brought to bear on them, and the men
who had ravaged the country and behaved like
robber barons for three years were forced to come
to an agreement. They were allowed to go out
with the honours of war, however. Once again, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
the reign of Henry V., the castle was in English
hands, but with the rest of Normandy became
French in 1450.</p>

<p>The fine abbey founded by Neel still remains,
though it has been so largely restored as to be
almost new built; one splendid aisle arcade remains
to tell us of its ancient origin. It now is the home
of the Sisters de la Miséricorde, while the castle,
after its stormy career, has settled into a peaceful
old age as a hospice for old people and children.
Bricbecque belonged to the Bertrands, from whom
the earls of Huntley and Dudley claim descent;
then to the Paisnels, and then to the D’Estoutevilles.
The castle is now a splendid ruin, with a high and
massive donjon keep, a deep, dark, tunnel archway,
a smaller tower, and a great part of the encircling
wall. In the courtyard, enclosed within part of the
ruin, is the Hotel des Voyageurs.</p>

<p>Of the older part of La Haye du Puits there is
only a ruined donjon, but the castles of Crosville and
Flottemanville stand in good preservation, though
fallen from their high estate to the condition of
farmhouses. The splendid tower at Crosville, with
its bastion turret, is well worth seeing, and the large
room, probably the banqueting-hall, is still decorated
on ceiling and frieze and panels with paintings done
in the sixteenth century, showing that up till then
it still remained the dwelling of the great ones of
the land. Flottemanville is as attractive in a rather
different style. They all have features in common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
these castles: the keep or tower for defence, their
proximity to the church, and their massive walls,
probably dating in their foundations from William’s
own time, but rebuilt at a later date, as by his
order all these strongholds were destroyed after
Val-ès-Dunes. But those we have mentioned are
only a few of the principal survivals amid the
numerous castles that stud the district.</p>

<p>Valognes itself has been from very early times
a centre of gaiety, and this reputation lasted up to
the eighteenth century. At present it is a quiet
yet busy town. It is built on no fixed plan; its
streets run anyhow. In the centre is the church,
which is quite peculiar, being surmounted by both
a spire and a dome of different dates. The main
part is of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, but
the dome was added in 1612. Inside there is some
superb wood-carving.</p>

<p>In the streets of Valognes, and everywhere in
the neighbourhood, may be seen a curious cap worn
by the women. It is edged in front by a high upstanding
ruche of black and white, with the ends
frayed out, giving the appearance of feathers, and
the whole at a little distance is not unlike an Indian
headdress. Everywhere in the Côtentin one meets
among the strong-faced farmers men who might
have been blood-brothers to William, men with
square faces, thin lips, and stern features. They
are often of massive build, and though not excessively
tall, certainly of greater height than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
ordinary French agricultural class. The Danish
blood has remained here with strange persistency
throughout generation after generation: these men
are not Frenchmen at all. You feel it the moment
you encounter them; they are a northern race with
northern characteristics.</p>

<p>Not far from Valognes, in its suburb Alleaumes,
are the ruins of the castle where William was
staying when he made his midnight escape. Besides
the history connected with its castles, the peninsula
has annals of its own. As the northern coast was
a very convenient landing-place from England, it
was often the Côtentin which bore the first brunt
of an English engagement. Edward the Confessor
landed here on mischief bent, but was driven back
by the inhabitants, who rose as one man under Neel
the Elder.</p>

<div id="ip_160" class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"><img src="images/i_304.jpg" width="700" height="502" alt="" /><div class="caption">CHERBOURG</div></div>

<p>While William the Red reigned in England, and
the feeble Robert was nominal Duke of Normandy,
Henry Beauclerc descended upon the Côtentin,
and ruled it for many years. His rule was firm
and good, and he was popular, and the peninsula
consequently enjoyed far more prosperity than the
rest of distracted Normandy. Henry’s power extended
as far south as Domfront, for the titles of
Count of Mortain and Count of the Côtentin still
went together. When Henry became King of
England he yielded the Côtentin to Robert, until
he won it back again by his sword. When Edward
III. swooped down upon France he passed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
the whole district capturing, burning, and destroying,
and none could stand up against his army.
Again, when Henry V. made an effort to retrieve
the domains which had belonged to his forefathers,
the Côtentin was swept from end to end. In the
religious wars, once again the town was in the midst
of turmoil, but it yielded to Henri IV. after the
battle of Ivry.</p>

<p>We have specialised only on a very small part of
the Côtentin, and that the least known, but it is
impossible to leave without mention of the famous
port of Cherbourg, the finest harbour in France.
The records of Cherbourg go back to the sixth
century, when a saint named Scubilion is said to
have resided here, and even before Scubilion’s day,
a still mistier and a nameless saint had landed here,
and converted the inhabitants. The breakwater at
Cherbourg, finished in 1853, can hold a fleet at
anchor, and is guarded by forts.</p>

<p>The town of Cherbourg is said to derive its name
from Cæsar’s Bourg, but the derivation is very
doubtful. William the Conqueror founded here a
college, which his granddaughter, Matilda or Maude,
incorporated into a new monastery of her own. The
castle was a great favourite with Henry I. It was
here he had been staying in November 1120, when
he set sail from Barfleur, leaving the merry company
of young nobles to follow with his son and daughter
in the <i>White Ship</i>. History gives it that the prince
himself might have been saved after the fatal wreck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
had he not returned at the cry of his sister, who had
been left on the wreck, whereupon so many leapt
into the boat that it was swamped. How persistently
the fact that only a butcher of Rouen was saved,
impresses itself upon the childish mind, so that years
after, when we have forgotten far more important
things, we still remember it!</p>

<p>Before we leave the Côtentin altogether, we may
mention that delightful chronicler Wace, to whom
we owe so much, and who wrote with the ease and
picturesqueness of a Pepys, in an age when composition
was a serious and dry-as-dust matter.
Wace was born in Jersey about 1100&ndash;20, therefore
he was a native of the Côtentin, in which Jersey
was then included. He is reported to have lived
to the age of eighty-four, and to have died in
England. His life was contemporary with the
reigns of Henry I., Stephen, Henry II., and Richard
I., and that which he records before 1100 was told
to him by word of mouth, partly by his father, to
whom he makes reference. His chronicle, which is
in the form of a poem, is called the <i>Roman de
Rou</i> (or Rollo), and the English translation of it
goes no further back than William I. Wace is
the most delightful and interesting of chroniclers
in an age which was singularly rich. Robert of
Jumièges, Ordericus Vitalis, and others have left us
accounts as full as any modern newspaper report,
of what happened in their days, and they are only
the leaders among a host of lesser men.</p>

<span class="subhead">DIEPPE AND THE COAST</span></h2>

<p>Passengers who land at Dieppe may perhaps be
conveniently divided into two classes&mdash;those who
pass through, intent on tours further inland or in
other countries, and those who go to Dieppe, as
they would to Brighton. It is pretty safe to
say that very few of either class really know the
place.</p>

<p>But Dieppe deserves some consideration apart
from its harbour and its beach; it is no mushroom
town of villadom, but has an old-world flavour, and
a delightful mingling of simplicity with its fashion.
We can see in it a series of charming pictures.
There is, for instance, a long, narrow, cobble-paved
street passing through the middle, running more or
less parallel with the front, and cut off from it by
a double wall of houses. But, alas, there are few
old houses, for gable end and ancient woodwork
went down before the furious bombardment of the
combined English and Dutch fleets in 1694, when
the bombs, falling in all directions, set the place on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
fire. After having done such damage that the
whole town had to be rebuilt, the fleet sailed away
to Havre. It is said that some of the rich inhabitants
at the first sign of danger hid their valuables
in the caves, which may be seen in numbers along
the limestone cliffs, and that 4000 houses in all
were burnt. Thus it is that there is nothing to be
seen in the streets anterior to this date. Nevertheless
there is a quaint irregularity in the nondescript
architecture that is very charming. And on a
Saturday morning the long street is lined by the
market women, who come in to dispose of their
country produce. They have no stalls, but sit on
the edge of the pavement on the sunny side, each
one with her basket or baskets ranged beside her.
Dazed hens with tied legs, faintly expostulating
ducks, baskets of pearly eggs, wedges of butter
under cool green leaves, great masses of roses and
other flowers&mdash;such are the goods for sale, and each
one represents a large amount of hard work and
patience. The women chatter gaily, comparing
produce and prices, their pleasant, brown faces
shining the while in the sun, until perhaps the babel
is for an instant stilled by a funeral passing down
the narrow street. The walking priests, in their
birettas, lead the procession, followed by the acolytes
and the silent coffin; they wind slowly over the
cobbles, and the solemn dirge rises on the summer
air; but it has passed, and is forgotten, and all is
happy tumult once more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Midway down the street, by the fountain, there
curves off another, at the end of which is the
magnificent church of St Jacques. It is only the
west end we can see in this vista, with its two
curious octagon turrets, gargoyle crowned, but as
we draw nearer, the fine western tower comes into
view. The church, like so many another, was begun
in the thirteenth century, and completed in the
sixteenth. The other notable church of Dieppe, St
Remi, stands further west, and is hemmed in by
houses; it was not begun until St Jacques was
nearly finished.</p>

<div id="ip_165" class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"><img src="images/i_312.jpg" width="700" height="511" alt="" /><div class="caption">THE GATEWAY, DIEPPE</div></div>

<p>If we go into St Jacques late in the afternoon,
when the sun is flooding that glorious western rose-window,
we shall find the whole building filled with
opalescent light. Soft patches of transparent colour,
amethyst and gold, far more glorious than even the
rich blue and orange of the glass through which
they filter, creep slowly across the aisle and climb
the pillars. They rest upon the bowed shoulders of
an old peasant woman, who sits with hanging head.
Her plain stuff dress and the print cap tightly fitting
her grey hair, the blue check apron telling of days
of toil, are all suddenly transformed into something
“rich and strange.” But she sits there with the
dark beads falling one by one through her work-worn
fingers, heedless of the glory in which she
is bathed; and if you go nearer you will see that
poor proud face drawn by lines of sorrow, and every
now and then the fingers are interrupted in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
work to wipe off those too insistent tears; evidently
no ordinary case this, but a woman who has
suffered trouble, and who comes to seek peace,
though happiness has left the world so far as she
is concerned.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful place this church, the mighty
chancel and transept arches seem to hold the
silence as a bowl holds water; one could not “strive
or cry” aloud here. Yet outside, through the open
door, one can see a patch full of life and movement&mdash;boys
darting to and fro, a carter unloading a van,
continual passers-by; and every now and then out
of the light a boy or girl flits into the solemn spaces
of the wonderful silence, gives never a glance at
the gorgeous colours that make one feel as though
one were in the heart of a jewel, but with a hasty
genuflexion passes out at the other door into the
market-place.</p>

<p>In the market-place there is medley and chatter,
bargain and sale. All the usual things are here.
Coloured curtains, masses of shoes, rows of shining
utensils, piles of snowy draperies, sweets, flowers,
toys, cakes in profusion. A yard of ribbon, a pair
of stuff shoes, a bit of glittering jewellery from that
fascinating stall where all goes at “quinze sous”
the piece, this is the extent of most purchases that
can be seen.</p>

<p>Behind the market-place rises one of the chapels
of the transept, built by Ango, whose history is told
in connection with the castle; its fellow is on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
other side, and in its solid plainness of design, and
with its worn stone, and two stages of red tiles,
the chapel is in delightful contrast with the ornateness
of the pinnacled and buttressed choir.</p>

<p>To the south and west of the church is another
market, one of the most repulsive imaginable. Spread
out on the open ground are old second-hand articles
of every description, from loathsome rags to rusty
iron.</p>

<p>If we pass down one of the narrow streets to the
east of the church, we come quite suddenly upon a
scene of a different order. Here is the basin where the
steamers lie, and the swing-bridge which leads to the
fishermen s quarter, Le Pollet, one of the two places
in Normandy where the Celtic influence still lingers.
There are some quaint superstitions and ideas held
by these men, but they are not ready to speak of
them. They are religious, and would not think of
letting a boat go out unblessed. One of the songs
which is chanted at the lighting of a candle in the
hold before a boat puts out to sea, is as <span class="locked">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“La Chandelle de bon Dieu est allumée<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Au saint nom de Dieu soit l’alizé-vent, unie, regulier<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Au profit du mâitre et de l’equipage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bon temps, bon vent pour conduire la barge.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Si Dieu plaît!”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>On the quay is the fish-market, and outside it a
mass of fisher-folk broken up into groups. The men
are nearly all rust-coloured in complexion, with hair
that curls fiercely and thickly, and among the younger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
ones is to be seen not infrequently that type of face
which, idealised, appears in the portrait of Gilliatt, in
the English translation of <i>Les Travailleurs de Mer</i>,
a face of a short oval, with small pointed chin, and
mobile, sensitive lips. Yet others there are as square-jawed
and bull-dog, as ruffianly in expression, as the
lowest among the sailors in London by the river.</p>

<p>The chaffering goes on hotly; two fine mackerel
are handed over at thirteen sous, four good ones, not
quite so fine, at sixteen sous. All the dealing is in
sous. Strange, evil-looking fish with large heads are
sold for a song, and each customer as she gets them&mdash;for
it is nearly always a she&mdash;slips them into her
string bag, and goes on her way rejoicing, with a
cheap and wholesome dinner for the young ones at
home. High on the cliff across the water, is the
stiff new little church&mdash;there is another in the town
below&mdash;and behind it, on the windswept cliff, the Le
Pollet cemetery, filled with the cheap wooden crosses
laden with those tawdry ornaments that mean so
much and tell so little. But the Le Pollet cemetery
does not account for more than a fraction of its dead,
for many a man and lad lie out beyond the point in
the shifting sea, and the wives and mothers at home
have no graves on which to lay their hardly bought
offerings. On Le Pollet, under the renowned General
Talbot, the English erected a fort called the
Bastille, a name still retained by its site.</p>

<div id="ip_168" class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"><img src="images/i_320.jpg" width="700" height="512" alt="" /><div class="caption">THE QUAY, DIEPPE</div></div>

<p>But in lingering by the town and along the quay,
we have not yet visited the castle of Dieppe, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
at the other end, rearing itself steeply on its mighty
cliff. For Dieppe lies in the valley between two
heights, and occupies the space dipping down to the
level of the sea, hence the name which signifies deep,
and is related to our names of Deepdale and
Deepdene. The castle hill was at first occupied by
a mere fort, which Rollo rebuilt; and Rollo’s fort
lasted until the time of Henry II. of England, who
rebuilt it entirely, but Henry’s fort stood a very short
time, for when Philip Augustus retook the country
from John, one of his first acts was to raze any
strong places which might afford the English a
foothold, and this fort was among the number.
Nevertheless his destruction was not entire, and
some of the walls attributed to Henry still remain
incorporated in the castle, which was begun by the
Dauphin, after the historic fight of Arques in 1435.
The four towers belong to this date, but various
additions were made later. There is no admission to
the castle now, and but little history to clothe its
walls in an aroma of the past. The most interesting
name connected with it is that of the merchant
prince, Jean Ango, who died here in 1551. Ango was
a native of Dieppe, and began life as a common sailor,
but he had in him that curious ability to seize his
opportunity, which goes to the making of a fortune
more than any other quality. He soon rose to be a
shipowner, and wealth bringing wealth, he owned a
whole fleet of vessels, and was a power on the sea.
When King François came to Dieppe, he was received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
and entertained by Ango in princely style. François
made his host governor of Dieppe in return, and
afterwards conferred upon him the dignity of a
vicomte. It was in 1525 that Ango built a house of
the old timber style, magnificently carved, on the site
where the Lycée now stands, opposite the station, by
the quay where the Newhaven boats arrive and
depart. Shortly afterwards he followed this up by
a country house at Varengeville, which is still
standing (see p. <a href="#Page_173">173</a>). Ango is described by a contemporary
as a big blonde man, with a large head and a
gay expression. For long he ruled as a prince, both
on sea and land; when the Portuguese had the
audacity to harass French shipping, it was Ango who
armed twelve ships and made war on his own account,
capturing several of the Portuguese vessels. The
king sent angrily to ask the French king why he had
done this, as the two countries were then at peace,
and the French king replied gaily that he must ask
Ango, who alone was responsible.</p>

<p>But this big, cheery, bluff man, a sailor at heart,
changed unaccountably in his old age; he grew
morose, suspicious, and overbearing; he quarrelled
with his neighbours, got himself entangled in lawsuits,
and finally, ruined in pocket and credit, had to
take refuge from his enemies within the castle walls,
where he died.</p>

<p>The general idea is that Arques is the parent
town of Dieppe, and that the men of Arques
gradually established themselves on the sea-coast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
for the purpose of fishing. Others, however, point
to the Camp of Cæsar, anciently called the City of
Limes, which is on the top of the hill near Puys, as
an old Gaulish settlement before the advent of
Cæsar, and say that this was the parent town,
and that the settlement at Dieppe came later, when
a great part of the cliff near the Gaulish town had
fallen bodily into the sea.</p>

<p>With the siege of the castle of Arques by
William the Conqueror we have dealt elsewhere.
But the castle of Arques, always a stronghold,
underwent a yet more terrible ordeal in the attack
by Henri IV. in 1589, when it was held by the Duc
de Mayenne. The king had 4000 men against
30,000 of the Leaguers, but the smaller force was
victorious, and the battle was long spoken of as a
miraculous event.</p>

<p>Having so far dealt with the immediate surroundings
of Dieppe, we turn now the coast-line.
The great white cliffs which rise vertically on both
sides of Dieppe have their counterparts in the
white cliffs of England, so exactly similar in structure
that no one can doubt they once joined across what
is now the Channel. Even were there no other
means of judging, the great friability of these cliffs
and the masses which continually fall off into the
sea, driving the coast-lines further and further
apart, would alone answer the suggestion in the
affirmative. All the way to Tréport stretches this
grand rampart. Tréport is situated in the embouchure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
of the river Bresle, and above it rise the
cliffs. It has a modern part with first-class hotels,
a casino, and other of the usual attractions, and the
older village nestles in the narrow valley ascending
from the beach. The beach is limited by the river
to the east, beyond which begins the beach of Mer.</p>

<p>Eu is a place of considerable importance in
Norman history. It is the outlying border town
of Normandy in this direction, and beyond it was
the vexed country of Ponthieu, between whose counts
and the Norman dukes there was so much fighting.
All those who have followed the chapter on the
Bayeux tapestry will remember that it was on the
territory of Ponthieu that the unfortunate Harold
was blown by wind and tide, and that it was Guy,
Count of Ponthieu, who brought his captive proudly
to William. He did not, however, do so until he
had been repeatedly commanded by William, who
also bribed him, though Guy was “his man,”
having done homage to him five or six years
previously. Eu had also been the scene of the
Conqueror’s marriage about ten years before, when
his Flemish bride, his own first cousin, had met
him here. The church which witnessed that famous
ceremony has disappeared, but the present one, a
fine building of the thirteenth century, worthily
replaces it.</p>

<p>In the Chapelle du College, a splendid building,
are some fine monuments to the Guises, whose name
was associated with Eu in the sixteenth century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
The elder Guise, François, was called Le Balafré,
because he bore on his face a horrible scar from a
sword-cut received at Boulogne; he was assassinated
in 1563, and succeeded by his son Henri, also
assassinated in 1588.</p>

<p>The whole coast-line is shingly, and its chief
characteristic is the up and down sweep of the
contour, which continually rises to the top of tall
white cliffs, and almost immediately falls again
right down to the sea-level, only to rise once more.
This peculiarity is admirable for its variety, and it
affords fine shelter to the seaside places in the
folds, but it renders any attempt at passing along
near the coast on foot or bicycle very tedious work.
The white cliffs, however, and the shingly beaches
make eminently beautiful foregrounds for a sea so
often blue in the sunlight which France seems to
attract so much more than England, and some of
the cliffs are crowned by fine trees or blooming gorse.</p>

<p>Going westward from Dieppe, we come to the
little village of Varengeville, standing high on the top
of the cliffs. It has two great attractions&mdash;one its
shady lanes, arched by beeches so as to resemble
veritable cathedral aisles, a thing unique in Normandy;
and the other the fine Maison d’Ango, now a farmhouse.
This is built round four sides of a courtyard,
and the walls are worked with marvellous
skill into various intricate patterns with the
materials of flint and brick. The latter, which
adorn the cowbyres, are set in even patterns, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
the effect with the red tiles and thatch is pretty
and curious. On one side of the mansion itself is
an open loggia or arcade, raised above the ground-level.
But the most striking and notable detail is
the columbier standing in the yard, one of the very
few remaining. It is cylindrical, and the walls are
worked in patterns of lines and bands in the same
way as those of the house. It terminates in a
curved dome-like roof. The whole is well worth
going to see, in spite of the churlish, and we must
add, in France, very unusual, spirit that animates
the present occupants. We pass many little places
ever growing in popularity, such as Veules and St
Valery en Caux, bearing family resemblance to
Dieppe in their situation in the breaks formed by
streams cutting through the chalk cliffs, and come
to Fécamp, which is a bit of a health resort, a bit
of a manufacturing town, and a bit of a fishing
harbour, without being particularly distinguished in
any one of the three things. From Fécamp, as
from all these northern fishing towns, there annually
sets forth that fleet for the cold waters near Iceland
so touchingly described in Pierre Lôti’s <i>Pêcheurs
d’Islande</i>.</p>

<div id="ip_174" class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"><img src="images/i_330.jpg" width="700" height="513" alt="" /><div class="caption">FISHERMEN AT FÉCAMP</div></div>

<p>Fécamp stands at the foot of cliffs from 300 feet
to 400 feet in height, around the base of which are
scattered the great blocks of débris with which the
seas play like footballs. The memory of the
terrible storm of 1663, when the whole of the valley
or chine was blocked by these stones, hurled up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
by the terrific power of the sea, is still preserved.
The chief claim of Fécamp to notice, however, is
its splendid abbey, of which the church still remains;
it was built in the Conqueror’s reign, burnt and
rebuilt, so that the greater part is of the thirteenth
century, and some dates from the reconstruction
in the fifteenth. What is left of the abbey has
been built into the public offices of the town.</p>

<p>But the strange legend of La Fontaine du
Precieux-Sang should come before mention of
the abbey, for it was because of this relic St
Waneng erected here the first religious house for
nuns. The story goes that a case containing some
of the blood of our Lord had been placed in the
cleft of a fig-tree by Isaac, the nephew of Nicodemus,
but in some way the stump had been cut down,
and reached the sea, from whence it floated unaided
all the way to Fécamp, and a well in the courtyard
of a house is pointed out as the actual spot where
it stranded. During a great conflagration this
precious relic was lost, but an angel brought it
back, saying, “Voici le prix de la redemption du
monde, qui vient de Jerusalem.” Needless to say,
this priceless relic drew thousands of pilgrims to
the shrine at Fécamp. They came in spite of wind
and weather; as the quaint old Norman song
has <span class="locked">it:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="in0">And the monks reaped a rich reward from their
ingenuity! Passing Valmont, with its old castle
of the D’Estoutevilles, we come to Etretat, a much
more fashionable bathing-place than Fécamp.</p>

<p>The coast at Etretat is grand and beautiful,
though the beach is stony. The sea with its ceaseless
work has carved caverns in the high cliffs. The
three principal headlands, standing grandly out to
sea, all end in a natural arch. Here, as elsewhere,
fishermen mingle with the gay crowd that increases
the population some five hundred per cent. in the
summer.</p>

<div id="ip_176" class="figcenter" style="width: 510px;"><img src="images/i_336.jpg" width="510" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">HAVRE</div></div>

<p>The wall of cliff continues right on to Havre,
where the Cape de la Hève feels the full shock of
the resistless north winds. Also the cliff is always
crumbling, with that law of nature that ordains that
the sea shall gain on the land on the rocky coasts,
and the land shall advance out to sea on sandy
beaches. Once or twice, more than mere crumbling
has taken place, for with a noise like the rumbling
of artillery the face of the cliff has broken away, and
fallen headlong into the sea, sending gigantic spouts
of water heavenwards, while the roar attracted
attention even at Havre. Havre has a population
of 120,000, and is a self-respecting busy town. It
has a very large traffic, and it is also favourably
situated for inland trade, being connected by a
dredged-out canal with Tancarville, and thence by
the Seine to Rouen. The mouth of the Seine is
here so treacherous and shifty, that without constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
dredging navigation would be impossible. There is
only one more remark to make before leaving
Havre, and that is, to tell how it earned its
secondary title of Le Havre de Grace. One of
those terrible high tides that about once in a
generation sweep through the Channel, appeared on
the coast and overwhelmed the breakwater, flooding
it to such a height that it seemed to the inhabitants
nothing remained for them but utter ruin, even
if they managed to preserve their own lives; when,
as they were momentarily expecting to see the
town swept from end to end by the lowering mass
of water, a new channel burst suddenly through
one of the walls which prevented the escape, and
the water flowed away into the bed of the Seine.
This was considered a special miracle in favour of
the town, which was henceforth known as Le
Havre de Grace.</p>

<p>A more complete contrast than that presented by
the next two coast towns could hardly be made. We
have Honfleur, old, picturesque, tumble-down, full of
fishermen, with a church which for quaintness could
hardly be surpassed, and we have the villa-ed and
elegant Trouville, resembling one of the most gaily
dressed of Parisians, where not a line is out of
order, nothing is left to chance, every fold, so to
speak, is arranged, every movement self-conscious.</p>

<p>I confess that to me such towns as Trouville
exercise a repulsive effect; the moment I arrive
there I want to flee, and yet it is impossible to overlook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
a place so patronised, so praised, so entirely
self-satisfied. Trouville is not Norman; it is a little
bit of Paris by the sea, and it is French entirely;
it does not share in the old Norman history, “C’est
le monde frivole, joyeux et bruyant qui s’agite et
s’amuse et dont les petit cris, les chants quelquefois
vulgaires et de gout douteux, et tous les bruits de
fêtes se percent dans le grand murmure de la mer.”
Hardly more than fifty years ago, Trouville was a
mere collection of fishing-huts; then someone saw
the advantages of the situation, the high cliff-like
hills, the surrounding woods, the flat sands, and
almost at once sprang up the hotels, the casinos,
the shops, and the other accompaniments of a
fashionable resort. Fishing is now the least of
its sources of wealth, or rather, perhaps, we
may say it is replaced by angling of another
sort. Deauville is a kind of offshoot of Trouville,
situated on the other side of the Fouques, a
lesser Trouville, a shade quieter, but after the
same pattern.</p>

<p>The next point to notice along the coast is the
mouth of the river Dives, where William assembled
his ships before setting out to conquer England.
They remained here waiting for a favourable wind,
and finally put into St Valery, at the mouth of the
Somme, from whence they made their real start.
The number of ships is estimated very variously;
Wace puts it at six hundred and ninety-six, a
number which he had heard from his father, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
he says he saw it stated in writing to have exceeded
three thousand, a number which may have likely
included every boat or flat-bottomed raft which
crossed over. William’s own ship, made like the
others of a boat-shape, with high prow, was
propelled by oars. It was brilliantly decorated; its
sails were crimson, and its metal parts were gilded;
the figure-head was a child armed with bow and
arrow, aimed at England. The whole was a present
from his duchess Matilda, and it is said that the
figure of the child had been copied from that of their
son Robert, a boy who was to cause them both so
much sore grief.</p>

<p>Then we come to the mouth of the Orne, on which
stands Caen. From the Dives to the Orne we have
had flat sands and sand dunes, a state of things
which continues still. Back from the coast is one
of the most splendid pasturage lands in Normandy,
only rivalled by those about the drained lands behind
Carentan. Ouistreham and the minor seaside
resorts near Caen are much patronised, and contain
hotels and villas to suit all purses. After passing
Courseulles, the hotels and shops and bathing
stations are left behind, and little fishing-hamlets
take the place of coast resorts. Port en Bessin is
situated in the fracture of a cliff, and there are in
the neighbourhood formidable rocks. Then we
come to the great angular Bay de Veys, in shape
not unlike our own Wash. Here stands Carentan,
and before the land was drained Carentan was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
almost surrounded with water, for the tides ran
far inland, making any attempt to pass that way
from the Côtentin hazardous and difficult. A grand
scheme was once mooted to build a large dike which
should protect these meadows, but the much more
reasonable scheme of drainage was tried, and has
succeeded. Instead of being marsh land, the flat
stretches now serve for pasturage. The town has
been no less than twelve times taken by the English,
in addition to which it suffered in the religious wars
of the seventeenth century. It is now a flourishing
port, carrying on an enormous trade in butter, of which
the exports in one year to Southampton alone were
equal to 15,000,000 francs! Isigny, which stands a
little eastward, is the chief butter-producer, so much
so that the name Isigny butter has come to be a
synonym for good quality. We have now reached
that strange peninsula, which, with exception of a
strip along the eastern side, is almost all of granite;
the coast town La Hogue marks the transition
from the one sort of coast to the other. We have
dealt so fully with the Côtentin and with its continuation
on the west to the little stream Couesnon, that
it is of no use to say more here. We would merely
remark that the action of waste by the sea can be
seen strikingly on the western side, where the
peninsula meets the full winds of the Atlantic.
History says, though the statement may be
accepted with caution, that at one time Jersey was
severed only by a narrow channel from the mainland;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
if this is so, then without doubt, at some far
distant geological epoch, the whole of the peninsula
will be worn away to one thin strip of sandy beach,
like those arms we see extending for miles along
the northern coasts of Germany.</p>

<span class="subhead">UP THE SEINE</span></h2>

<p>A great river always exercises an attraction upon
a certain class of people, and when that river is
lined by historic towns and flows through beautiful
country, it cannot fail to be attractive to everyone.
As we have said, the Seine belongs to France rather
than Normandy; very French are the views of its
olive green flood, with the blue-green fringe of
poplars, and the cliff-like scarred banks to be seen
so continually in its course; but yet in some of the
towns we shall pass, especially the smaller ones,
there still lingers the breath of things Norman.</p>

<div id="ip_182" class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;"><img src="images/i_346.jpg" width="700" height="506" alt="" /><div class="caption">QUAI ST CATHERINE, HONFLEUR</div></div>

<p>The mouth between the two similarly named
towns of Harfleur and Honfleur is very wide, but not
good for navigation, for it is filled with perpetually
shifting sandbanks, which try the mariners’ patience
to the utmost. For this reason there was made that
canal from Havre to Tancarville which ensures at all
events a certain passage. The wide funnel-like
mouth narrowing suddenly near at the corner by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
Quillebœuf, and again below, is the cause of the
great mascaret, or wave of the high tide which sweeps
up occasionally as far as Caudebec; this is a great
wall of water, higher or lower according to the force of
the wind and the strength of the tide, which together
combine to produce it. The bar or line which sweeps
up first is the advance-guard of an unusually high
tide, which will carry destruction to all small or
badly managed boats. The mascaret is regularly
reckoned among the sights of Caudebec.</p>

<p>It is magnificent in its impetuous flow, coming on
in irresistible force, the water turning, writhing, and
twisting under the impetus, with a fringe of foam
outlined on the indigo slopes&mdash;a strenuous thing,
living, growling, hungry for its prey.</p>

<p>As the wide mouth of the river contracts a little,
the ruined castle of Tancarville is seen standing on
its precipitous cliff. This belonged to the Sires de
Tancarville, one of the proud Norman families who
held the hereditary chamberlainship of the dukedom
of Normandy. The last of the line was killed on the
field of Agincourt, and the name, disguised as
Tankerville, is held by an English peer. The
chateau as it is now, consists partly of the ruins of the
ancient chateau, to which is attached the new chateau,
so called. The older parts date from the twelfth
century, the newer from the eighteenth. The gateway
is still imposing, with its two flanking towers;
and the small dungeon-like rooms with iron-barred
windows, in which the unhappy prisoners were kept,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
can be seen. Most of the building is, however, of
the later date. The towers, by their name, suggest
the wild, stirring days of old; we have la Tour de
l’Aigle, la Tour du Diable or du Lion, and la Tour
Coquesart. In the keep is a well three hundred feet
deep. Quillebœuf, from its position on a rock
stretching out into the flood, was at one time a place
of no small strategic importance.</p>

<p>Opposite is Lillebonne, charmingly situated amid
woods, and owning one event of historical importance
which gives it dignity. It was in the castle of
Lillebonne that William held the celebrated council,
in which it was finally decided he should attempt the
subjugation of England. That Lillebonne has been
of importance from very ancient times, is shown by
its splendidly preserved Roman theatre, which is
celebrated throughout all the world of antiquaries.
The ruins are now overgrown, but that the place
could easily accommodate 3000 spectators is apparent.
Near the theatre are the remains of William’s castle;
but ruins of this sort are so common in Normandy,
that they hardly provoke comment. After this the
river takes its first great bend before Caudebec;
nothing is more curious than the amazing sinuosity of
the Seine, which forms loops and horseshoes of extraordinary
length.</p>

<p>Caudebec is one of the most charming of the small
Norman towns, and is beloved of artists; unfortunately,
as it advances in fame it loses that
unsophisticated innocence which was one of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
delights. The church is so magnificent that it merits
the designation cathedral, and the quaintness of the
ancient timber houses leaning over the narrow street,
down which, as in all mediæval cities, a stream runs
to carry off the refuse and drainage, is part of the
delight of this little place.</p>

<p>The forests that line the Seine, sometimes on one
side and sometimes on another, from this point
onward, merit a special word. Wonderful are they,
rising high on wooded slopes or stretching over acres
of flat country. Some, as those opposite Jumièges, are
of beech almost entirely, with a sprinkling of dark
evergreens; others are varied. There are forests of
firs penetrated by “rides cut as straight as rulers”
through a chunk of solid tree-growth; there are
others so mixed up with intertwining creeper that to
penetrate them would be impossible.</p>

<p>Jumièges is in exactly the place where you would
expect to find an abbey. They loved a broad
encircling river those old monks, they loved to be
surrounded by wide forests, to build on low ground:
their idea was defence, not aggression; the peace of
those who are passed by, not of those whose strength
defies invaders.</p>

<p>We must cross the Seine somewhere, and we
cross it at Jumièges, in an open boat, for there is no
bridge. And not long before the crossing we have
caught our first glimpse of those twin towers, so
unlike anything we have seen before. And when we
reach the abbey and walk in that grand ruined nave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
the feeling is rather one of increased exaltation than
of the disappointment nearer vision so often brings.
If we had to choose one word to express the quality
here wrought into stone, it would be stateliness. The
abbey stands roofless and serene, a mighty nave with
two western towers, which, beginning squarely, end
by being octagonal, with the walls in four stages, and
with a chancel arch which, for height and grace, has
hardly ever been surpassed.</p>

<p>Long before the days of the mighty William whose
name overshadows the land, before the time when
his ancestors had taken root in the country, a monk
named Philibert settled in this place with his small
following, to lead a life of peace and order, amid the
wildness and ignorance of the ninth century.</p>

<p>But even this well-chosen spot was not secluded
enough to save him from the marauding northmen;
the very river, which had seemed a safeguard, was its
undoing, for the pirates came up the river and found
the spot, and utterly destroyed all Philibert’s labour.
But as the years passed, and the northmen settled
down, no longer as pirates but landholders; as
Christianity claimed their king, William Longsword,
the abbey was rebuilt on a much grander scale.
Edward the Confessor spent his exiled boyhood at
Jumièges, and when he came to the throne he made
the learned abbot Robert, Bishop of London, and
subsequently Archbishop of Canterbury, an appointment
that did not prove a success.</p>

<div id="ip_186" class="figcenter" style="width: 511px;"><img src="images/i_354.jpg" width="511" height="700" alt="" /><div class="caption">CAUDEBEC-EN-CAUX</div></div>

<p>In the fourteenth century the library at Jumièges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
was one of the most notable in the land. Till 1790
this abbey continued whole, and sheltered a household
of five hundred persons, including monks. It is
now the property of a French lady, who permits
visitors to see over the ruins with a caretaker. Not
far off is Duclair, and the greater part of Duclair
lies along the front of the river. It certainly lacks
beauty, and after Caudebec the contrast is striking;
but Duclair has interest. Its high chalk cliffs are
imposing in their sheer precipitousness, and the
deep, dark caverns, used as dwellings which are
made in their sides, are weird and uncanny. One
of these cliffs, from its size and shape, is called the
Chair of Gargantua. With another immense dip
southward, and corresponding rise, we come to Rouen,
with its islands, and its bridges, and its busy life.</p>

<p>The end of the next horseshoe brings us within a
few kilometres of the preceding one, and once more
we double back on our tracks to reach Pont de
l’Arche, an attractive place, much patronised by
artists, above which the Eure joins the Seine. On
the former river, only about nine miles away, is
Louviers, with a magnificent church, celebrated for
its decorated porch, which rivals those at Rouen.
Continuing in the main stream of the Seine, we come
soon to the range of chalk cliffs which leads up to
Chateau-Gaillard. Many of these might be castles
themselves, so curious is the effect of the rough,
grey rock, outcropping suddenly from the green
turf. The even strata look remarkably like lines of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
stonework laid by hand, and the general ruggedness
and hoariness are just that which ruins gain by time
and exposure, and at first it is difficult to distinguish
the castle itself, so closely does it resemble the rock
on which it stands.</p>

<p>Chateau-Gaillard was built by Richard I., as an
outpost or defence on the Seine below Rouen, and
it was instantly recognised by the King of France
as being the key to Normandy; while the castle
stood untaken, no one could hope to approach Rouen
with any chance of success. Standing as it did on
the borders of Normandy and France, it was many
times a meeting-place for the two kings, when fair
words were spoken and promises made, only to be
broken and renewed. It was not until after the
death of Richard, when John’s dastardly act had
alienated from him all who were not dependent on
him, that Philip advanced against it. It was held
by Roger de Lacy, a man of known courage, and
it was well prepared for a siege. Among the defences
were a stockade across the river and a fort upon the
island in midstream. But by encamping on the
further shore of the river, Philip managed to break
down the stockade, and replace it by a pontoon or
bridge, thus he could surround the island fort; but
even John the Shifty could not see one of the noblest
castles in his dominions so attacked without an
effort at succour. He planned well. A part of his
force was to fall by night upon the French camp
on the left bank of the Seine, and at the same time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
a flotilla of boats was to attack the pontoon.
Unfortunately the ebbing tide, combined with the
strong current, prevented the flotilla’s arrival in
time. The land troops did their part, and so fiercely
were the French attacked that they fled across their
bridge, but they rallied and returned, and, overcoming
their foes, were ready to meet the English
boats when they appeared. It is a gallant fight to
picture, under the clear sky of an August night.
The first alarm, the scurried retreat, the stumbling,
and slipping, and scrambling of the terrified fugitives.
The straining into the darkness of the men on the
island-fort, who could not conjecture what was going
on. The clash of steel, the splash of water, the
cry as one went down, the breathless expectation in
the air. Then the pulling together of the demoralised
Frenchmen by one or two strong officers, the
reforming and recrossing the now swaying and
half-broken bridge, the stringing up of those half-beaten
troops to face the foe, the struggle, the sense
of victory, the final rout; but that was not the end;
after having reformed and repulsed the boats, the
Frenchmen, drunk with the wine of victory, set fire
to the island-fort, and seized it also, while the
defenders fled in terror, and joined by the whole
population of the little village, now left defenceless,
demanded admittance and refuge at the castle gates.
A desperate picture truly. And above, overhanging
the flood on its rock, the saucy castle was watching,
crouching, eager, expectant. Had friend or foe won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
the fight? Was relief at hand? There would be
no eye closed within the walls that night, and then
would come the hurried knocking, the parley, the
admittance of the fugitives with their disastrous
tidings, and with the first grey light would come
the confirmation of despair, when the French bridge
was seen repaired and intact; and alas, not the
bridge only, but the island in the hands of the
enemy!</p>

<p>After this one attempt&mdash;in which, however, he
seems to have played no personal part&mdash;John made
no effort to relieve his gallant castle; though he
was at Rouen in November, and sent a letter to
the commander in ambiguous language, a letter to
chill the hearts of those who bore arms for him.
Nevertheless, the garrison held out until March
6th in the next year, 1204, and with its fall the fate
of Normandy was sealed. Chateau-Gaillard is the
jewel that makes the fame of both Les Andelys,
but there are other things to be seen here also, a
fine church in each place, and at Le Grand Andely
a splendid old sixteenth-century house, now used as
an hotel. Poussin the painter was a native; he was
born in 1594, and he must have had plenty of
opportunity for the exercise of his talent in the
scenery around his home.</p>

<p>It is impossible to mention Les Andelys without
at the same time referring to Gisors, which lies some
fifteen miles eastward, on a feeder of the Seine, called
the Epte. Gisors is not in itself an interesting town;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
its main street is dull, its river is of the sluggish,
canal-like variety, its streets lack pretty peeps; but
all is atoned for by the beautiful ruin of its castle,
which is well and worthily made use of. It stands
high behind the main street, and is not readily
seen. But the grounds enclosed by the still strong
and perfect wall are open as a public park, and on
the soft green grass, beneath many shady trees,
countless hosts of children daily play. There is no
attempt to keep the place too stringently; the grass
grows long, and may be trodden underfoot. The
grey hoary keep rises high, to give character and
dignity to the scene; and behind, outside the walls,
is a magnificent wood. The castle was built by
Rufus, added to by his successor, and repaired by
Henry II. It, with Chateau-Gaillard, was one of the
castles on the outer line of defence of the duchy lying
in that much-disputed ground, with the appropriate
name of Le Vexin, and it stood many a siege.
There were two surrounding walls to be taken
before the stronghold; the keep could even be
assailed, and Gisors must have been a tough nut
to crack. The whole district is full of the ruins of
castles showing the perpetual state of warfare and
uncertainty which must have prevailed.</p>

<p>Returning to our river, we soon come to Vernon,
the very last town in Normandy, chiefly known on
account of its forest and its seven-arched bridge.
With this we take leave of Normandy, over which
we have wandered in so desultory a way, gathering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
impressions, examining some things in detail, leaving
others aside, but all the while intent on gaining an
insight into that character and individuality which
marks the country. We have found it in the west
still preserving traces of its rulers, who made its
fame; to the east, almost wholly French. We have
found it full of variety and delight, full of historical
interest, and that mostly of a far past generation.</p>
